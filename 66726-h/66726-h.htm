<p>My publisher tells me that this volume will
be regarded as a sequel to ‘The Minor Horrors
of War,’ and he assures me that sequels
are not a success. I have no doubt my
publisher is right, because if publishers were
not invariably right, and authors invariably
wrong, how can one explain the fact that
publishers are proverbially prosperous and
prominent people, whereas authors are notoriously
penniless and obscure? In spite of
his warning, however, I propose to publish
this little volume, for there still ‘air some
catawampous chawers in the small way, too,
as graze upon a human pretty strong’—as
‘one of them inwading conquerors at Pawkins’s’
called them—that were unmentioned
in my earlier book.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the kindness of the
Editor and Proprietors of the <i>British Medical
Journal</i> for permission to reprint Chapters I to
IX and Chapter XI, and to the Editor of <i>The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</span>
Journal of Economic Biology</i> for permission to
reprint the twelfth chapter, of this book, and
I offer them my thanks. I also thank Mr.
Hugh Scott (the University Curator in Entomology),
and Professor G. H. Carpenter of the
Royal College of Science, Dublin, for much
kindly help.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>COCKROACHES (<i>Periplaneta</i>)</small></h2></div>

<p>
<i>The Governess:</i> And, perhaps, Mabel, as they are not black
and as they are not beetles, you will in future call them cockroaches.</p>
<p><i>Mabel:</i> Certainly, Miss Smith, although they are not cocks
and they are not roaches.</p>
<p class="psig">(<i>Punch.</i>)</p>


<p>In ‘The Minor Horrors of War,’ we rather
neglected the Navy—the senior Service, and
till now the more dominant of our two magnificent
forces—partly because it is less interfered
with by insect pests than is the sister
Service, though the common pests of our
poor humanity—the flea, the louse, the bug—are,
like the poor, ‘always with us.’ Like
aeroplanes, insects have captured the air;
like motors, they have made a respectable
show on land; but they have signally failed
at sea. They have nothing corresponding
to battleships or submarines; and a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
bug, called <i>Halobates</i>, alone hoists the insect
flag on the ocean, and that only in the warmer
waters.</p>

</div>

<p>Insects are not only highly intelligent
animals, but are by far the most numerous
and dominant class of the Animal Kingdom;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
and they have probably come to conclusions
about themselves and the sea, comparable to
those expressed by Dr. Johnson about man
and the ocean: ‘To all the inland inhabitants
of every region the sea is only known as an
immense diffusion of waters, over which men
pass from one country to another, and in
which life is frequently lost.’</p>

<p>But one insect at least causes more
trouble to sailors than to soldiers—and that
is the cockroach. Like the bed-bug, the cockroach
came into England at the end of the
sixteenth century, and, like the bed-bug, it
came from the East. It seems to have been
first introduced into England and Holland
in the spacious times of Henry VIII by the
cross-sea traffic, and from about the end of
the sixteenth century the cockroach began
gradually to spread throughout the Western
world. Like the rat, the bed-bug, and the
domestic fly, it has become thoroughly acclimatised
to human habitations, and is indeed
an associate of man. It is very rarely found
living apart from some form or other of
human activity.</p>

<p>This insect seems to have been first
described in England in Moufet’s ‘Insectorum
Theatrum,’ 1634, and he speaks of it as living
in flour-mills, wine-cellars, &amp;c., in England,
and he tells us how Sir Francis Drake took,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
in 1584, the <i>San Felipe</i>, a Spanish East
Indiaman, laden with spices and burdened
with a great multitude of flying cockroaches
on board.</p>

<p>This species was <i>Periplaneta orientalis</i>; but
there is another and a larger species, which
presumably came into England from the West
later than its Eastern cousin <i>P. americana</i>—which
can frequently be seen in England
running about in the cages in our zoological
gardens—but it is not on exhibition, it is a
by-product, and is not counted in the fee
for admission to the gardens.</p>

<p>Latter tells us there are ten species of
<span class="smcap">Blattodea</span> which occur in Britain; but only
three of these are indigenous, and these three
all belong to the genus <i>Ectobia</i>. <i>Ectobias</i> are
smaller than cockroaches, and do not frequent
human habitations, but live in shrubs, under
rubbish heaps, &amp;c. Some species of <i>Ectobia</i> are,
however, very destructive and have been known
to destroy in one day the whole accumulation
of dried but not properly salted fish in a Lapland
village. Of the remaining species of cockroach
most are local, and occur sporadically
in particular factories, or places where food is
stored but they are not very widely spread.</p>

<p>As we have said above, <i>P. orientalis</i> is
the common English cockroach, <i>P. americana</i>
occurs especially in zoological gardens and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
menageries; but a third species, <i>P. germanica</i>,
sometimes gets established. Mercifully, <i>P.
germanica</i> does not seem to spread. Neither
<i>P. germanica</i> nor <i>P. americana</i> seem to make
much headway against <i>P. orientalis</i>, which
appears to be predominant over both these
other species.</p>

<p><i>P. germanica</i> is probably most methodical,
very thorough, very brave, very faithful—but
rather lacking in the power of understanding
the point of view of others. If it
has any association with its specific name, it
illustrates the most striking example in the
world’s history of the divorce of wisdom from
learning. ‘O Lord! give us understanding,’
should be the prayer of <i>P. germanica</i>.</p>

<p>Miall and Denny tell us that from the first
introduction of <i>P. orientalis</i> into England
it took two centuries before it spread far
beyond London. In 1790 Gilbert White
speaks of it as ‘an unusual insect, which he
had never observed in his house till lately,’
and, indeed, at the present moment many
English villages are still blissfully ignorant
of this particular nuisance.</p>

<p>As Fig. 2 shows, the cockroach is a somewhat
slackly put together insect. One might
almost call it rather slatternly and loose-jointed—and
the latter it certainly is. Its
head moves freely on the thorax, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
thorax on the abdomen. The successive segments
of the latter move very freely on
one another. The legs are long and mobile,
and so are the antennae with which the
animal is ceaselessly testing the ground over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
which it flits hither and thither in its restless
activity.</p>

<p>Cockroaches are very difficult to catch.
They practically never walk, but run with
a hardly believable rapidity, darting to and
fro in an apparently erratic mode of progression.
Even when caught they are not
easily retained, for they have all the slipperiness
of a highly polished billiard-ball. They
have great powers of flattening their bodies,
and they slip out of one’s hand with an amazing
dexterity. Besides their slipperiness they
have another weapon, and that is a wholly
unpleasant and most intolerable odour, which
is due to the secretion of a couple of glands
situated on the back of the abdomen. The
glands which produce this repellent odour
are sunk in the soft membrane which unites
the fifth and sixth abdominal segments, and
the moment a cockroach is attacked it exudes
a sticky, glue-like fluid, which gives out this
most unendurable smell. The fluid is extraordinarily
tenacious and difficult to remove
from the hand of those who have touched
the insects. No doubt the cockroach, in
nature, finds safety in this from the attacks of
insectivorous animals.</p>

<p>Cockroaches, as has been said, very rarely
walk, they nearly always run, and they advance
the first and third leg of one side at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the same time as the middle leg of the other,
pulling themselves forward with their front
legs and pushing themselves forward with the
hindermost. They are thus constantly poised
on a tripod. They occasionally, but not very
often, use their wings for flight. When they
do so, their anterior wings are stretched out
at right angles to the body, and take no
active share in beating the air. They act
in effect as monoplanes. It is the hinder
wings which really do the active flying. After
a flight, the hinder wings are shut up something
in the manner of a fan.</p>

<p>The flattened coxae, or thighs, of the
leg are adapted for shovelling débris back
from beneath the body when the insect is
enlarging its habitation. When the cockroach
gets into a dusty ‘<i>milieu</i>’ the dust is immediately
removed; the hairs on the legs
act as clothes-brushes and brush every part
of the body, whilst the antennae, which attract
any dust in the neighbourhood, are repeatedly
drawn through the closed mandibles and so
cleaned. A cockroach is able to walk on
smooth surfaces because it possesses between
the joints of the tarsus certain soft, white
patches, very velvety, and these give the
creature a good hold, and prevent slipping
even on glass.</p>

<p>Cockroaches will eat pretty well every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>thing.
They are a great nuisance on board
ship, where they are said to gnaw the skin
and nibble the toe-nails of sailors. Hardly
any animal or vegetable substance is absent
from their menu. It is said that they will even
devour bed-bugs, and that natives on the
African shores, troubled by these semi-parasites,
will beg cockroaches as a favour from sailors
in passing ships.</p>

<p>The mandible (Fig. 3), with its strongly
toothed surface, is capable of biting and
grinding into fragments a very varied diet.
The food is moistened by the secretion of
the salivary glands, which is capable of con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>verting
starch into the more soluble sugar.
The food is further ground up by a series
of hard ridges projecting into the inner face
of the gizzard (Fig. 4, 7). The secretion
of the so-called hepatic caeca is capable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
emulsifying fat and rendering proteins soluble.
Thus the ordinary food substances are reduced
to a condition in which they are capable of
diffusing from the lumen of the alimentary
canal into the blood which floods the body
cavity.</p>

<p>The external movement—one might almost
say ‘the panting’—which is very
obvious in the abdomen, the alternate
flattening and deepening of this part of the
body, is a movement of inspiration and expiration,
the air being driven into the stigmata
and so into the tracheae or breathing-tubes.
There is a considerable variation in the rate
of these pulsations, but the cockroach’s heart
beats at an average rate of seventy to eighty
contractions per minute.</p>

<p>Although cockroaches have fairly developed
eyes, they seem to trust very largely to tactile
impressions in appreciating their relations to
the surrounding world. Their antennae and
the palps of their first and second maxillae
are constantly touching the surface on which
they are resting or moving, and from time to
time their antennae wildly wave in the air in
a manner which suggests that they are smelling
out the external circumstances which environ
them. The 39,000 sensory ‘nerve-endings’
which are found in the antennae of the male
cockroach are almost certainly olfactory in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
function. At the posterior end of the body
the two ‘cerci’ are also sensitive to tactile
impressions, and probably act at the hinder
end of the cockroach as the antennae act
at the forward end. Cockroaches are certainly
keenly sensitive to light, and, as every one
knows, they shun the light, and when detected
in daylight or candle-light they make as
quickly as they can for some dark hole or
crevice in which to hide.</p>

</div>

<p>Cockroaches breed during the summer,
and their eggs are laid in packets of sixteen
in a capsule or cocoon with rounded ends, and
with an upper corrugated edge. These cocoons
are very like the little hand-bags ladies have
carried since the dressmakers denied them
pockets. There are sixteen ovarian tubes in the
female, and each of these deposits one egg in each
cocoon. The ventral portion of the seventh abdominal
segment in the female is shaped like the
prow of a boat, and it is in this structure that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
the cocoon, or egg-case, is built up. Each egg
is fertilised by a spermatozoon which has been
deposited by the male in the spermatheca
of the female. The eggs are placed in a
double row, eight in each row, facing each
other, and, as they gradually develop, it
becomes apparent that the ventral face of one
row faces the ventral face of the other row—just
as the little choir-boys on the Gospel
side of a chancel face the little choir-boys on
the Epistle side, but much nearer together—and
that their heads are all directed towards the
corrugated ridge.</p>

<p>They are at first quite white, but with large
black eyes, and it has often struck me how
surprised they must be when they awake
to consciousness and find themselves staring
at a brother or sister cockroach just opposite,
of whom they have had hitherto no consciousness.
The ripe embryos secrete some
fluid, probably saliva, which dissolves the
ridge, and it is through this dissolved or
softened ridge that they ultimately make
their way into the outer world.</p>

<p>Young cockroaches are very active, running
about and seeking everywhere for any food
of a starchy nature. They are, in fact,
miniatures of their parents, for a cockroach,
like many of the primitive insects, has a
direct development, and there are no such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
stages as caterpillar and pupa in their life-history.</p>

<p>But, like other insects, cockroaches change
their skin from time to time, and they lose
little time before beginning this ecdysis, for
they first cast their cuticle immediately after
escaping from the egg-capsule. The second
ecdysis is four weeks later, and the third at the
end of the first year, and after this time they
moult annually. At the seventh moult, when
the animal is now four years old, it assumes
the form of the perfect insect, and is capable
of reproduction. The later moults fall in
the summer time, and so does fertilisation
and oviposition. Male cockroaches may
be distinguished from the females by their
well-developed wings and wing-covers. They
stand higher on their legs than do the
females, whose abdomens often trail upon
the ground.</p>

<p>In spite of the noxious secretion of their
abdominal glands there are creatures who
habitually feed on cockroaches—hedgehogs,
for instance, are frequently imported into
our houses to check these pests. Rats, cats,
polecats, frogs, and wasps have been known
to eat them, and some few of the digging-wasps
lay them down in their larders for
the use of their progeny. Some birds will
also tackle them. But even the most devoted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
friend of cockroaches can find little to say in
their favour, except that they are currently
reported to form the basis of the flavouring
of a very popular sauce; but even wild cockroaches
will not drag from me what the
name of that particular sauce is.</p>

<p>Cockroaches do a very considerable amount
of damage by consuming food-supplies. But
they do not stop at food-supplies: woollen
clothing, newspapers—not a really great loss—blacking,
ink, leather, and even emery-paper,
are all to their taste, and, being of an economical
frame of mind, they devour their own cast
skins and the dead bodies of their relatives.
The late Professor Moseley recorded how on
one occasion, when on the circumnavigating
tour of H.M.S. <i>Challenger</i>, a number of cockroaches
took up their abode in his cabin and
devoured parts of his boots, ‘nibbling off all
the margins of leather projecting beyond the
seams on the upper leathers.’ He further
records:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>One huge winged cockroach baffled me in my
attempts to get rid of him for a long time. I could
not discover his retreat. At night he came out
and rested on my book-shelf at the foot of my bed,
swaying his antennae to and fro, and watching
me closely. If I reached out my hand from bed
to get a stick, or raised my book to throw it at him,
he dropped at once on the deck, and was forthwith
out of harm’s way. He bothered me much, because,
when my light was out, he had a familiar habit
of coming to sip the moisture from my face and
lips, which was decidedly unpleasant, and awoke
me often from a doze. I believe it was with this
object that he watched me before I went to sleep.
I often had a shot at him with a book or other missile
as he sat on the book-shelf, but he always dodged
and escaped. His quickness and agility astonished
me. At last I triumphed by adopting the advice
of Captain Maclear and shooting him with a pellet
of paper from my air-gun, a mode of attack for
which he was evidently unprepared.</p>

<p>It is on record that cargoes of cheeses
have been destroyed by cockroaches on ships.
Not only did they devour great quantities
of each cheese, but they defiled every one of
them with their very tenacious fluid which
has, as we have noted above, a most disgusting
smell. This the cockroaches poured out from
their stink-glands, making the cheeses of no
commercial value.</p>

<p>When a cockroach casts its skin a median
longitudinal slit appears on the back of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
thorax, and through this slit the insect slowly
emerges. With much labour and difficulty
it squeezes its body through and pulls one
limb after another from its old integument,
until at last even the long
whip-like antennae are
completely withdrawn.
Certain portions of its
inner anatomy—such as
the lining of parts of the
breathing-tubes, or tracheae—are
also withdrawn.
Should the discarded skin
not be eaten by the emergent
insect, it remains on
the floor, and might easily
be mistaken for a sedentary
cockroach but for the fact
that live cockroaches never
are sedentary.</p>

<p>The incomplete metamorphosis,
the generalised
character of the nervures of the hind wings,
the complete separation of the three thoracic
segments (or rather their want of that
fusion so conspicuous in the higher insects—the
flies and the bees) and the undifferentiated
condition of the mouth parts—all
point to the insect being of a primitive type.
But there is no doubt that, whether a primi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>tive
insect or not, the cockroach is a very
successful one; it is an <i>arriviste</i>—as ‘our
lively friend, the Gaul,’ to quote Mr. Micawber,
would say—probably owing to its attaching
itself in all cases, and with unvaried devotion
to the habitation of men. Not popular with
humanity, it nevertheless ceaselessly extends
its domain by slowly yet surely entering into
new and hitherto unconquered human habitations.
In spite of insect-traps and vermin-killers,
it is extremely difficult to eradicate
from a house when once it is well established.
It has, in fact, gradually dislodged in most
places in Great Britain and Ireland the old
domestic house-cricket. For in spite of its
irritating, and to some people quite maddening,
ticking, the ‘cricket-on-the-hearth’ has
somehow established itself as a household
pet, and one that has won not only our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
respect but our affection. So curious is our
psychology.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The cockroach has many enemies, and the genus
<i>Sphex</i> (or <i>Chlorion</i>) may be seen hunting about
here and there, up and down the road-side and
gardens, searching for its favourite prey. It spies
out a cockroach, which appears to know intuitively
that there is danger at hand, for it shows symptoms
of great fright, and seems so confused that it cannot
run away. The <i>Chlorion</i> pounces upon the insect,
clasps it with its mandibles between the head and
the corselet, and stabs it in the body with the sting.
Then it flies off for a little distance, and awaits the
effects of the poison thus introduced; and when
the convulsions of the victim have ceased, the clever
little insect seizes its stupefied prey, and drags the
heavy burden with great efforts to its nest. Usually
the opening of the cavity is so narrow that the
cockroach cannot be got in, for its legs and wings
stick out and prevent its introduction. But the
<i>Chlorion</i> sets to work and cuts off the legs and the
wings, and having thus lessened the difficulty, it
strives hard to push the body into the hole; but as
this plan usually fails, the hymenopteron enters
first of all, seizes the cockroach with its mandibles,
and drags it in with all its force. As the integuments
of the <i>Blatta</i> are more or less soft and flexible, the
great insect is at last forced into the gallery, where
it never could have been expected to have entered.
Such proceedings on the part of the <i>Chlorion</i> almost
verge upon the domain of reason; and it is difficult
to explain them by the notion of that very indefinite
quality called instinct, for the manœuvres vary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
according to the circumstances, and there appears
to be an intelligent method of overcoming every
difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Apart from animals which eat it, there
are a number of parasites which infest it,
beginning with the parasitic beetle <i>Symbius
blattarum</i>, whose wingless females attach
themselves to the bodies of the cockroaches
and feed upon their tissues. Then occasionally
a round-worm, <i>Filaria rhytipleurites</i>,
whose sexual stage is passed in the rat, is
found in its larval stage in the fat bodies of
the cockroach.</p>

<p>Two years ago Dr. C. Conyers Morrell
undertook some investigations and observations
as to what part, if any, cockroaches
played in the dissemination of pathogenic
microbes, his object being, as he says, ‘first
to ascertain what bacilli belonging to the
colon group are likely to be conveyed to food
and milk by this insect, and secondly to find
whether known bacteria and moulds can be
transmitted by the faeces.’ Dr. Conyers Morrell’s
experiments were conducted on one of
the Union Castle liners sailing to South Africa,
and the insects which were investigated were
collected only from the larder or passages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
adjacent to the kitchens; in no case were
they taken from lavatories or from staterooms.
The general condition of the ship,
which was almost new, was one of exceptional
cleanliness, and thus afforded good
conditions for the experiments. Dr. Morrell
was of opinion that there was little danger
except by contamination from the faeces of
the infected insect.</p>

<p>One of his first experiments was to prove
that should cockroaches fall into the dough
which was being baked for bread the heat of
the baking entirely destroyed the bacilli that
were in the alimentary canal of the insect.
With regard to infection with the colon bacillus,
he kept an infected insect under the best
antiseptic conditions he could compass until
it had passed some undigested food. Of
this undigested food an emulsion was prepared,
and cultures were made from it on
bile-salt medium and in litmus-milk. Afterwards
special cultures were made in gelatine
and peptone solutions. Incubation was conducted
in all cases at 37° C., and cultures
were made from seventeen specimens. Five
of these produced colonies of bacilli on the
bile-salt medium, with sub-culture results as
follows: Four produced acidity and clotting
of milk, acid, and gas in glucose, lactose, and
saccharose, and production of indol. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
bacilli did not liquefy gelatine, and were
Gram-negative. One specimen produced gas
in glucose and lactose, and liquefied gelatine
and coagulated milk. The former in its reaction
corresponded to the <i>Bacillus lactis
aërogenes</i>, the latter to <i>Bacillus cloacae</i>.
In five cases greenish moulds of the <i>Aspergillus</i>
variety were found after inoculating
litmus-milk.</p>

<p>Cockroaches will devour human sputum
with avidity, and are frequently to be found
in spittoons (or, as the more delicately
minded American calls them, ‘cuspidors’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>),
and it is interesting to know that after feeding
the insects on infected sputum from a tuberculous
patient, the tubercle bacilli are found
in the faeces within twenty-four hours; two
specimens which had been fed on staphylococci
showed these pathogenic organisms in
their faeces and in the cultures on agar-agar,
which were obtained from their dejecta.</p>

<p>I have quoted largely from this important
paper, and now propose to quote a good deal
more, and thus I append Dr. Conyers Morrell’s
conclusion of the important experiments
he conducted on the Union Castle liner.</p>

<p>The foregoing experiments, though insufficient
in number to afford a basis for working out per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>centage
results, are, I think, of some value, in that
they prove the following facts:—</p>

<p>The common cockroach is able by contamination
with its faeces (1) to bring about the souring
of milk; (2) to infect food and milk with intestinal
bacilli; (3) to transmit the tubercle bacillus; (4) to
disseminate pathogenic staphylococci; (5) to transmit
from place to place destructive moulds.</p>

<p>These facts, taken in conjunction with the life-habits
of the insect, lead to the conclusion that
the cockroach is able to and may possibly play a
small part in the dissemination of tuberculosis,
and in the transmission of pyogenic organisms;
that the insect is in all probability an active agent
in the souring of milk kept in kitchens and larders;
and that it is undoubtedly a very important factor
in the distribution of moulds to food and to numerous
other articles, especially when they are kept in
dark cupboards and cellars where cockroaches abound.
The distribution and numbers of the cockroach are
rapidly increasing, and unless preventive measures
are adopted the insect is likely in the course of time
to become a very troublesome and possibly a very
dangerous domestic pest.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<small>THE BOT- OR WARBLE-FLY (<i>Hypoderma</i>)</small></h2></div>

<p class="center">Apropos de bottes.—(<span class="smcap">Reynard.</span>)</p>


<p>Britain wants many materials in this war,
and as long as our back door is open we are
getting them. Petrol, rubber, zinc, copper,
molybdenum, vanadium, thorium, nickel, saltpetre,
wool, cotton, are all coming to us
in greater—immeasurably greater—quantities
than those in which they can filter through
neutral countries into Germany. These things
count. The shortage of leeches in Great Britain,
on which I have already dwelt, is negligible,
and is entirely over-balanced by the really
serious shortage of sausage-skins in middle
Europe. I am told that our meat-salesmen
at Smithfield were offered an incredible
advance on the normal rate for these products—so-very-necessary-and-under-no-circumstances-to-be-done-without-with-casements—but
the meat-salesmen at Smithfield
were patriots. In their dire extremity the Germans
have been trying to make them of cellulose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>Amongst the things both combatants most
want is leather. One of the most impressive
efforts we non-combatants have been watching,
since August 1914, is an army growing,
near us and next us, with apparently an unlimited
supply of leather belts, leather trappings,
leather saddlery—leather harness for
man and beast. Yet they tell me that the
price of leather since the War began has appreciated
by 140 per cent. This may be so; but,
as Joseph Finsbury remarked in ‘The Wrong
Box,’ ‘there is nothing in the whole field
of commerce more surprising than the fluctuations
of the leather market. Its sensitiveness
may be described as morbid.’ But Joseph
was no business-man, and kept in the background
of the office a capable Scot who was
understood to have a certain talent for book-keeping.
Readers of Stevenson will remember
that nobody had ever made money
out of Finsbury Brothers, Leather-merchants,
except the capable Scot who retired (after
his discharge) to the neighbourhood of Banff,
and built a castle with his profits. There
are still many capable Scots about, and this
may, to some extent, account for the present
price of Sam Browne belts.</p>

<p>There must have been well over 150,000
Sam Browne belts made since the War began.
A widespread belief—at any rate, amongst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the junior members of the Army—is that
Sam Browne was an American; possibly some
slight confusion existed in their dear young
minds between the inventor of the belt and
John Brown whose ‘body lies,’ &amp;c. The
inventor of this useful cincture was, however,
Sir Samuel James Browne (1824-1901), G.C.B.,
K.C.S.I., the well-known Indian fighter, who
lost an arm, and gained a V.C. by his gallantry
during the Mutiny. He was for a time the
military member of the Governor-General’s
Council, and he commanded the first division
of the Peshawar Field Force during the Afghan
War of 1878-9. The 22nd Regiment in the
Indian Army, a frontier force, is known as
Sam Browne’s Cavalry.</p>

<p>The belt was first used unofficially, but it
gradually found favour with the authorities,
and it is mentioned officially in the regulations
drawn up for the Straits Settlements in
1891, and for Egypt and West Africa in 1894.
It was only on April 24, 1900, that the pattern
was ‘sealed,’ and adopted as a general item
of equipment for all officers on Active Service.</p>

<p>Anything that seriously destroys the continuity
of the integument of our oxen, which
interferes with the ‘wholeness’ of the hide
which is the basis of leather, clearly affects—and
affects detrimentally—an important
munition of war. The bot- or warble-fly does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
this. But it does more: its attacks materially
lessen the value of the beef which potentially
lies beneath the hide, and thus in a double sense
the warble-fly is the enemy of man whether
he be soldier or sailor. Further, its attacks
seriously lessen the milk-supply of the
country.</p>

<p>Amongst the numerous families into which
the true flies (<span class="smcap">Diptera</span>) are divided, none are
more harmful to human enterprise than that
of the <i><span class="smcap">Oestridae</span></i>, or bot-flies, inasmuch as
every single species and every single member
of this family passes its larval stage within
the tissues of some vertebrate host, and frequently
in those of domesticated cattle; sometimes
even in man himself. One of the
commonest genera of this family of flies is
<i>Hypoderma</i>, which is represented in our
islands, and in many other parts of the world
where domesticated cattle are reared, by two
species—<i>H. bovis</i> and <i>H. lineatum</i>, both commonly
known as bot- or warble-flies.</p>

<p>The harm caused by these larvae, living
as they do in the tissues of the body, beneath
the skin, by piercing holes through the integument
or skin, whereby they make their exit
from the ‘warble’ or subcutaneous tumour
in which they have passed their latest larval
stage, is almost incalculable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>Miss Ormerod, who for so many years
kept alight the lamp of economic entomology
in England, published some statistics on this
subject towards the end of the last century. In
1888, out of slightly over 100,000 hides dealt
with in the Newcastle cattle and skin market,
60,000 were ‘warbled,’ and the loss to the
trade amounted to £15,000. The same year
at Nottingham 8500 out of 35,000 hides were
largely spoiled; at Manchester 83,500 out of
250,000 suffered from the same cause: the
losses in these towns being estimated for
the year in question at about £2000 and
£17,000 respectively. Taking the average
from all sources in England, Miss Ormerod
estimated the fall in value at from 5s. to 6s.
on every warbled hide. The most riddled
hides—that is, those with the most punctures—come
to the sale-room during April and May,
but the trouble extends from February to
September.</p>

<p>There is also the loss caused by the warble
to the butcher—and through the butcher
to the Army Service Corps. The presence
of the fly-larva, which is quite a large creature,
induces chronic inflammation in the
tissues, and a state of things known to the
trade as ‘licked beef,’ and unless the meat-salesman
cuts away the affected parts the
meat is unsaleable in the market, or greatly
depreciated in value. The average loss to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
the butcher on a warbled carcass is estimated
at 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Finally there is a loss to the stock-raiser
and dairy farmer. We shall have occasion
later to refer to the curious psychological
effect the warble-fly has upon the cattle,
causing them to ‘gad’ or stampede in wild
gallops, which interferes with fattening, deteriorates
the milk-supply, and is especially
injurious to cows with calf. Mr. Imms, in
his most useful summary of the warble-fly,
tells us that the loss due to <i>H. lineatum</i> in
America is calculated at 28 per cent. of their
total value of all the cattle in the States.
Some authorities place the total loss to
the agricultural community in England at
£2,000,000, others at £7,000,000, a year, whilst
others estimate that the loss amounts to about
£1 sterling on every head of horned cattle.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the fly itself is rarely
seen, and still more rarely taken. Mr. Imms
records only two specimens of <i>H. bovis</i> in the
collections of the British Museum, and but
fifteen of <i>H. lineatum</i>. A similar scarcity
of imagos in public collections obtains on the
other side of the Atlantic, where for many
years the last-named species was alone recognised.
Two years ago, however, Dr. Hadwen,
working in Canada, established the widespread
existence of <i>H. bovis</i> in the Dominion;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
almost certainly it also occurs in the States;
but Dr. Hadwen had to send to Dublin for
specimens with which to confirm his find.
None existed in the collections in Ottawa,
and a ‘request for a specimen ... from the
Bureau of Entomology at Washington, D.C.,
could not be granted owing to a scarcity
of specimen’! These statements are interesting,
since at present the tanneries of
Canada are working night and day to help
our shortage in leather at home.</p>

<p><i>H. bovis</i> measures ⅝ in. in length, <i>H.
lineatum</i>, somewhat less robust, ½ in.; the
hairy covering of the last named is of a foxy
red at the tail end, while that of <i>H. bovis</i> is
yellow, both at the tail end and towards the
front of the body. The flies are most abundant
during July and August, though they are
believed to occur throughout the summer.
At Athenry (co. Galway) <i>H. lineatum</i> is common
by the middle of May. They fly very
rapidly, and are difficult to follow with the
eye. They rejoice in warm, sunny weather,
and remain in retirement during cold or
cloudy days. Hadwen describes the egg-laying
by the female ‘as a sort of frenzied
process, the fly striking’ with its ovipositor
twenty or thirty times rapidly, then leaving
the animal for fifteen minutes or so, when
the process was repeated. The eggs are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
attached one at a time to the hairs of the
cattle and very close to the base of each hair,
not near the tip, where the horse bot-fly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
deposits its ova. The eggs of <i>H. bovis</i> are
scattered and isolated; those of <i>H. lineatum</i>
are arranged in rows of some seven or more
half-way up the hair and are contiguous.
The favourite region for placing the eggs is on
the hock and on the back of the knee, or on
the thighs and flanks, and hence the American
cowboys call the insect the ‘heel-fly.’ Undoubtedly
by standing with their legs in water
the herd is delivered from the pest—at any
rate, for the time.</p>

<p>The eggs are large, 1·25 mm. in length,
and enclosed in a whitish shell, which is prolonged
behind into a brownish foot, and this
foot, which exudes some sticky excretion,
adheres to the ruminant’s hairs. The foot of
the egg-shell, in fact, consists of two lobes or
valves, which clasp the hair between their
sticky inner surfaces.</p>

<p>Within the egg the youngest of the four
larval stages is maturing. When hatched it is
less than 1 mm. long, but it is ‘a terror for its
size,’ being armed with a formidable spine and
two hooks in the mouth, and with rows of
strong spines on all the body-segments. Later,
we find a second stage, very much smoother
and less spiny than the first and this lies
within the tissues of the host, embedded in its
muscles and membranes, notably in the submucous
coat of the gullet; and now the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
question confronts us, which once confronted
George III apropos of the apple in the apple
dumpling, ‘How the devil did it get in?’
There seems to be with <i>Hypoderma</i> but two
possible modes of entrance into the body
of its host—that is, domesticated cattle: (1)
The eggs, or the newly hatched larvae, are
licked up by the tongue, as are the eggs of the
horse bot-fly—and this might be held to
explain the not infrequent occurrence of the
second larval stage in the walls of the oesophagus;
or (2) the larvae bore their way directly
through the skin. From experiments carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
on for several years which show that cattle
unable to lick themselves are not protected
from warbles, Professor G. H. Carpenter of the
Royal College of Science, Dublin, concluded that
the larvae do not enter by the mouth. During
the summer of 1914, he and his able assistant,
the late Mr. T. R. Hewitt, definitely proved
that ‘the newly hatched maggot does bore
through the skin of cattle’; probably after
an ecdysis they find their way to the submucous
coat and muscles of the gullet, and
here for a while they rest. I quote from the
account of Carpenter and Hewitt some of
their most crucial experiments carried out
at the Athenry and Ballyhaise Stations of
the Irish Department of Agriculture:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In July 1914, twenty-four maggots were hatched
in the incubator, and some of these were used for
observations as to behaviour when placed on a
calf’s body. Glaser, in 1913, had tried to carry out
observations of this kind by placing maggots on a
shaved portion of a calf’s skin; he found that they
made no effort to bore through. Instead of being
shaved, a small patch of the shoulder of one of the
Ballyhaise calves was clipped, so as to have the conditions
as normal as possible, when newly hatched maggots
of <i>H. bovis</i> were placed on it. Immediately they
started crawling down the clipped hairs to the
skin, and, as soon as they reached the surface, they
began to burrow. On account of their small size
it is hard to discern them, but by carefully watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
through a lens it was seen that they enter perpendicularly
to the surface, evidently cutting into the
epidermis with their mouth-hooks and occasionally
bending their bodies. Mr. R. G. Whelan, A.R.C.Sc.I.,
Superintendent of the Ballyhaise Agricultural
Station, kindly helped in the observations and confirmed
them. Six hours after being placed on the
calf, the maggots disappeared completely. Next
morning the spots where they had entered were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
marked by little pimples, like those of the Athenry
animals, easily to be seen with the naked eye. These
increased slightly in size, but soon healed up, and
in less than a week not a trace of the maggots’
entrances could be found. The boring-in of the
maggots seemed at first to cause the calf a little
pain, but the symptoms of discomfort soon passed
away.</p>

<p>We have still to find out what happens to the
first-stage larva after it has bored into the skin
and how far it travels before it undergoes its
first moult. Gläser found that some eggs of <i>H.
lineatum</i> laid on his trousers hatched, and that a
maggot bored right through into his own skin.
From symptoms of swelling and pain in various
regions he concluded that this maggot travelled
to his gullet, and he finally extracted it (in the
second stage) from his mouth.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter illowp63" id="fig11" style="max-width: 53.125em;">

  <div class="captionl"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>—Entrance hole

discharge from the hole, which has hardened. Magnified 12 times. (From
Carpenter, Hewitt, and Reddin, <i>Journ. Dept. Agric., Ireland</i>,
xv., 1914.)</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps in the first stage they may be
carried by the blood stream. They seem in their
second larval stage to wander freely through
the tissues, especially through the muscular
tissues, of the body of their host—usually
working upwards, and not infrequently reaching
the neighbourhood of the vertebral column
before taking up—still in the second larval
stage—their final position, where their presence
gives rise to the ‘warbles,’ or subcutaneous
cysts or tumours, in which the third and fourth
larval stages are passed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>
<p>It seems odd that an insect pest, which
so seriously affects our supply of leather, of
meat, and of milk, should have been studied
for over a century and yet conceal its chief
secret from man. But the problem is much
more difficult than the layman thinks.</p>

<p>Whatever be the route the maggot travels
through the body of the calf or cow, by the
spring the fourth larval stage—when it is about
an inch long, and perhaps half as much in
breadth—is reached in the ‘warble’ or cyst,
under the skin. Here, nourished by the
products of the inflammation it sets up, and
breathing by two spiracles at the hinder end
of its body, which are directed to the opening
of the ‘warble’ which it has pierced through
the skin, the larva rests until one fine morning
it pushes its way, aided by its stout bristles,
through the opening and tumbles into the
outer world.</p>

<p>Apparently it does not think much of its
new surroundings, for it loses no time in hiding
under some clod of earth or stone or crevice
in the soil, and straightway turns into a dark
brown pupa or chrysalis. This stage lasts three
to four weeks, and then the perfect fly emerges,
and will soon be ready to lay her eggs on some
new victim.</p>

chased by fly. Note terrified look of eyes. (From Hadwen.)</div>
</div>

<p>As a rule it is the yearlings who suffer
most, and then the two-year-olds; the older<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
cattle being comparatively immune. The inexplicable
terror which the warble-fly induces
in its victims is testified to on all hands, but
has never been adequately explained. <i>Hypoderma</i>
does not bite, neither does it sting.
Many other blood-sucking insects, whose puncture
must involve some pain, are tolerated
by cattle with a flick of the tail, or are frightened
off by a gesture of the head; but the
presence of the warble-fly induces a mysterious
fear which rapidly spreads through a herd,
and results in a general stampede—often
referred to by cattle-breeders as the ‘gad.’
This terror communicates itself even to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
‘stalled ox,’ and cattle confined within cowsheds
show symptoms of extraordinary unrest
when the fly is abroad amongst their kin in
the pastures. The resulting evils are, of
course, far graver in the unlimited prairies of
the West—the great cattle-breeding districts
of the United States and Canada—than in
our carefully hedged or fenced meadows. A
great many ‘dips,’ ointments, and chemical
solutions have been recommended for the prevention
of the grubs in cattle, but none have
proved entirely satisfactory. The tedious
method of removing the grub from the tumour
is the only safe one. This can be done by
the mere pressure of the fingers when the grub
is nearly mature and ready to leave its host,
or by the use of small forceps should the grub
be young and recalcitrant. Once removed the
grub should be immediately destroyed, and
some such antiseptic as coal-tar applied to the
lips of the vacated tumour.</p>

<p>There is no zoological distinction between
a mosquito, a gnat, or a midge. But, as a
matter of convenience, we might confine the
term ‘gnat’ to the genus <i>Culex</i>, the term
‘mosquito’ to the genus <i>Anopheles</i>, and the
term ‘midge’ to the genus <i>Ceratopogon</i> and
its congeners, whose collocation with the
naked knees of the Highlander is said to have
given rise to the ‘Highland Fling.’</p>

<p>There is no doubt about it that both the
mosquito and the gnat are extraordinarily
beautiful insects. This fact, however, has
been veiled from the public partly owing to
their small size and more especially because
of their irritating bite, which causes the
sufferer to kill a mosquito at sight rather than
examine its fairy-like beauty or its fascinating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
dances in the air, far surpassing in grace and
agility anything seen in the Russian ballet.
But biting is the dominating note of a mosquito,
and we may as well consider, to begin
with, how it bites.</p>

<p>If we examine the head of a mosquito we
shall find that it is shaped like a circular
cushion bearing two enormous eyes—so large
that in the male they touch above the forehead
and almost meet below the chin. Each
eye consists of hundreds of facets of a brilliant
green hue, set in a darkish background, like
emeralds arranged on a black surface. The
head also bears a quantity of hairs and flattened
scales whose number, shape, and arrangement
are of considerable systematic value.</p>

<p>The following are the appendages of the
head:—</p>

<p>1. A pair of antennae, which are markedly
different in the two sexes.</p>

<p>2. A pair of mandibles. These are absent
in the male.</p>

<p>3. A pair of first maxillae, each of which
has a jointed tactile palp.</p>

<p>4. A pair of second maxillae which have
fused together to form a deeply grooved soft
process in which the other appendages lie.</p>

<p>Beside these four pairs of appendages,
which are in reality modified limbs, there are
two median processes, which project one from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
the top, the other from the bottom, of the
mouth, like elongated and hardened upper
and lower lips. These are the median labrum
above—a deeply grooved structure whose edges
approximate and almost touch, thus forming a
tube along which the blood of the victim is
sucked. Lastly, there is the hypopharynx—sometimes
termed the tongue—a median
structure a double-edged sword, rising from
the bottom of the mouth, and it is this that
is the cause of all the trouble.</p>

</div>

<p>A glance at Fig. 13 will show how these
various mouth appendages can by a skilful
use of dissecting needles be separated out,
but in nature they are all packed together in
a case; the arrangement in the case is shown
by Fig. 14, which represents a transverse section
of the proboscis. The term ‘proboscis’ is
given to the totality of all these structures
taken and packed together. With the exception
of the labium and of the tactile maxillary
palps all the mouth appendages lance into
the skin. The proboscis of the male is, how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>ever,
too weak to pierce the human integument,
and it is the female which does all the
damage. When a mosquito is going to bite,
she alights so gently that
her approach is unperceived,
and she proceeds
to thrust her arsenal of
weapons into the epidermis
of her victim almost
unfelt; the feeling
comes later. These
weapons are all guided,
by the forked end of the
softened labium, just as
one’s finger-tips guide
the end of a billiard-cue.
These ‘mouth parts’ are
exceedingly fine, extremely
sharp-edged
structures, whose consistency
is about that of
whalebone, and both the
mandibles and the maxillae
have a toothed,
serrated edge (Fig. 15). They are partly
pushed in by muscles in the head, partly, I
think, by the lowering of the body, and they
sink slowly and surely into the flesh with as
much ease as a paper-knife will penetrate a
cream-cheese. But as they sink deeper and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
deeper into the integument the body of the
mosquito approaches nearer and nearer to the
skin of the victim, and the labium is pressed
farther and farther backwards until at the end of
a satisfactory puncture the distal and proximal
parts of the labium are parallel and touching.</p>

</div>

<p>It is rather an interesting point that the
labium does not enter the skin, because the
larvae of certain <i>Filarias</i>—one of which produces
elephantiasis in man, and the other
severe heart trouble in the dog—are found in
pairs—probably a male and a female—in the
labia of mosquitos. How exactly these nematode
larvae leave the labium of the mosquito,
and enter the body of the man and the dog,
has not definitely, I believe, been cleared up;
but that they do enter the human and the
canine skin seems certain.</p>

<p>We have mentioned that the labrum is a
grooved tube with its edges practically in
proximity, and it is up this tube that the blood
of the bitten is sucked by the well-known
suctorial pharynx which occupies so large a
part of the interior of the head of a mosquito.
Much the most dangerous weapon of the whole
armoury, however, is the hypopharynx. This
is shaped like a double-edged sword with a
very minute groove running down the centre;
this groove is so minute that Professor Nuttall
and I and others for some time took it to be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
closed tube. It receives at its base the products
of the salivary glands of the mosquito, and it
is these products which contain the organisms
which cause malaria—a disease which has
probably caused more trouble and has played
a greater part in the history of the world
than any other malady to which humanity
is heir. Down this minute, microscopic groove
has flowed the fluid which has closed the
continent of Africa for countless centuries
to civilisation, and which has played a dominating
part in destroying the civilisations
of ancient Greece and of Rome.</p>

<p>When the adult mosquitos (the imagines)
leave their pupa-cases they are unable to pierce
the human skin until the mouth parts have
hardened, and this takes at least six hours.
In England they can undoubtedly feed
twenty-four hours after leaving the pupa-case.
When feeding, both the sensory antennae and
the tactile maxillary palps are thrust forward
at right angles to the proboscis. They thus
test the place where the two-lobed extremity of
the labium will guide the battery of stylets into
the substance they are feeding on. The female
is much more voracious than the male, which,
as we have mentioned above, cannot pierce
the human integument, and has to be content
with a vegetarian diet. Sometimes the effort
even of the female mosquito to insert its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
proboscis is fruitless, and we have watched
a mosquito attempt four times to pierce the
skin before it drew blood. If undisturbed
during the meal the suctorial repast may last
some two or three and a half minutes. So
greedy at times is the mosquito that she
resembles Baron Munchausen’s horse after the
adventure with the portcullis—what is flowing
in at one end is flowing out at the other.
In fact, as Dr. Johnson said of the boys at
a school ‘where discipline was maintained
without recourse to corporal punishment,’
‘But, sir, what they gain at one end they
lose at the other!’ After the process of biting,
of sinking-in of the piercing needles, is complete,
the proboscis is withdrawn, and to do
this the mosquito braces herself on her legs
and raises her body.</p>

<p>Another curious feature about the head
of <i>Anopheles</i> is that it is pierced by two chitinous,
symmetrical tunnels—tubes which are
open at each end with trumpet-shaped orifices.
The use of these is probably to act as a stay or
strut to strengthen the chitinous exoskeleton of
the head; but these queer galleries or tubes also
to some extent act as attachments for muscles.</p>

<p>The antennae vary very much in the two
sexes. In the female there are fifteen segments,
each bearing a ring of hairs, but of
small and disproportionate size, whereas in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
the male the bushy character of the hairs is
conspicuous even to the naked eye. In fact,
it is the easiest criterion for judging the sex
of the insect. At the base of the first joint
of the male antenna is a deep cup-shaped
structure packed with sense organs, and containing
a large nerve ganglion. There are
sixteen segments in the whole antenna, one
more than in the female. The hairs are
capable of movement, and as a rule are kept
closed on the shaft of the antenna whilst not
in use; when evening comes on they are
spread out. There seems little doubt that
these organs are auditory and help the male
in searching for the female.</p>

<p>The beautiful transparent wings of the
mosquito are beset with minute spikes, which
serve to break up the light and to give rise
to the many-coloured iridescence of the creature’s
wings. The posterior border of the
wing bears rows of beautifully graded scales.
These add much to the symmetry and beauty
of the whole structure. Just behind it are
two balancers or halteres—a name derived from
the Greek word ἁλτῆρες, meaning a kind of
dumb-bells which athletes used in the stadium
when jumping. These so-called balancers
project outwards and backwards from the body
when the wings are in a position of flight.</p>

<p>A curious distinction between the <i>Culex</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and <i>Anopheles</i> is in regard to the position
assumed by the insects when they rest. In
<i>Anopheles</i> the proboscis and body are
almost in one line, and the axis of the body
is at an angle with the surface upon which it
rests. <i>Culex</i>, on the other hand, has its proboscis
at a slight angle with its body, and
its body is almost parallel to the surface
upon which it is perching. <i>Culex</i> has a much
more hump-backed appearance than <i>Anopheles</i>,
and its legs are considerably shorter and
stouter. The insect generally rests upon four
out of six legs; in the former case the hinder
pair are held out and curved upwards. The
hind legs not infrequently serve as a test for
food. When feeding upon sweetened milk
or fruit, the moment the hind leg touches the
fluid or juice the insect will wheel round and
at once begin to feed.</p>

<p><i>Anopheles maculipennis</i> is very widely
distributed, and it has been recorded from
most parts of North America and Europe, and
from many parts of Asia. Probably the species
is much more widely distributed than we have
any record, but individuals do not wander very
far, of their own accord, from the breeding-places,
though they may be dispersed by the
wind. Cases are known where they have been
blown as far as ten or even twenty miles; and
in camping in Africa it is always well to keep to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
the windward of a native village. They are also
carried about by trains, motors, and steamers.
They do not indulge in any such voluntary
migratory flights as the locusts, although
some such flights have been from time to time
recorded, but these ‘swarms’ are probably due
to a high wind catching a large number of
mosquitos temporarily associated.</p>

<p>In a joint paper which Professor Nuttall
and I wrote some years ago, we drew attention
to a case in which mosquitos came aboard a
ship some ten miles from land, and to another
in which a Spanish barque from Rio was detained
in the South Atlantic quarantine station
of the United States. The vessel was so much
infested with mosquitos that it was rendered
nearly uninhabitable, and the United States
quarantine officer reported that when the
forecastle was opened after fumigation ‘the
mosquitos could be scooped up by hand.’
The master of the barque was positive that
there had been no mosquitos on board until
the twenty-second day out. Howard quotes
a letter from a General living in Texas in
which he states he has ‘twice seen flights of
<i>Culicidae</i>,’ but as the species and the genus
are not given, much of the interest of the
statement evaporates. Generals living in
Texas are not invariably remarkable for meticulous
accuracy in recondite scientific matters.</p>

<p>The female imago hibernates. Finsch made
observations and found it hibernating on
the frozen Siberian tundras, beneath the moss
and snow. Sterling found them in North
America when the snow was melting, in great
numbers, and he and his party were subsequently
terribly bitten. There is no doubt that
female imagines live throughout the winter,
and they can be found in England, hibernating
in cellars, old out-houses, chicken-houses, or
disused farm buildings. These hibernating
females disappear early in May, presumably
having laid their eggs. Dr. Thayer of Baltimore
describes these creatures, having found
them on the roofs and walls of barns near
New Orleans. Whether the male also hiber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>nates
is doubtful. Grassi says he never found
the male of <i>A. maculipennis</i> in the winter,
only fertilised females. But as the warm
weather sets in the female generally becomes
active and bites, and the native American
Indians consider these elderly and famished
females give more annoyance than at any other
stage in the life-cycle of either sex. In the
warmer climate of Southern Italy they not
infrequently hibernate in grottos and caves. At
times they occur in such numbers that they
can be swept up. After depositing their eggs the
hibernating females probably die. This usually
happens in May.</p>

<p>In the old days we used to collect gnats,
keep them in a receptacle unprovided with
any food, and when, after a couple of days,
they died of starvation we wrote poems or
essays on the ‘Transitoriness of Life’ and
the ‘Evanescence of Time.’</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nowadays, we feed them. Bananas,
sweetened milk, pineapple, or almost any
other vegetable juice, is their diet, and in
captivity they will live for weeks. At Cambridge
in 1900 (July to August), Professor
Nuttall was successful in keeping females alive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
on a diet of bananas and water from two to
eight weeks, but it was found essential to keep
the atmosphere fairly moist and the food
fresh. Grassi found that he could only keep
<i>Anopheles</i> alive in his laboratory in Rome
for a month.</p>

<p>Both <i>Anopheles</i> and <i>Culex</i>—at any rate, in
captivity—lay their eggs early in the morning.
Apparently the nature of the food has some
effect upon their fertility, certain observers
stating that when male and female are fed
on vegetable food alone there is no fertilisation
and no oviposition. A diet of blood evidently
assists the female to lay her eggs, and perhaps to
get them fertilised. One of our female <i>Anopheles</i>
laid a batch of 146 eggs, and subsequently
laid six more. But, as a rule, a fertilised
female does not lay a second batch unless
she receives a second meal of blood. The
eggs are laid two or three days after the meal.
There is also some evidence that a meal
of blood is necessary if fertilisation is to
be effected. As Austen says in <i>The Report
of the Sierra Leone Expedition of the Liverpool
School of Tropical Medicine</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The following law is likely to hold good for the
<i>Culicidae</i> which feed on man—at least for the common
species; although these gnats can live indefinitely
on fruit, the female requires a meal of blood both
for fertilisation and for the development of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
ova. In other words, the insects need blood for
the propagation of their species.</p>
</div>

<p>Undoubtedly, if mosquitos ever talk, they
would talk like Mr. Waterbrook, Mrs. Henry
Spiker—Hamlet’s aunt—and the ‘simpering
fellow with weak legs’ talked when David
Copperfield dined with the first-named at Ely
Place, Holborn. The burden of their song
was: ‘Give us blood.’</p>

<p>But a word of caution must be given here.
Most of these deductions are based upon
mosquitos in captivity; whether the same
be true of them in natural conditions is not
quite certain. If it be so it is difficult to
see how these countless millions of gnats
and mosquitos which dwell in the barren
regions around the polar circle ever keep
going.</p>

<p>It very frequently happens in the Animal
Kingdom that females are much more numerous,
as well as much larger, than the males.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> As
Kipling tells us: ‘The female of the species
is more deadly than the male,’ but Professor
Nuttall and I did not notice that this
was the case with <i>Anopheles</i>.</p>

<p>There is some evidence that the male hatches
out earlier than the female, and that in Southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Europe there may be three or four generations
in the course of the season: the first beginning
in April and the fourth taking place between
the middle of September and the middle of
October. After that date no larvae were
found. About four generations also occurred
in the neighbourhood of Cambridge, according
to observations of Professor Nuttall.</p>

<p>Kerschbaumer has calculated that if the
average number of eggs laid by a female be 150,
the number of the descendants by the fourth
generation would amount to 31 millions. This
readily accounts for the fact that in certain
parts of the world they occur in perfectly
enormous numbers, and if it be true that
blood is essential for fertilisation and oviposition,
very few of these potential mothers
can breed. In nature they will feed on a
great number of vegetable juices—melons,
wild cherry-blossom, bananas, oranges, overripe
mangoes; they suck the ‘juices’ of
allied species of insects just when the imago
is issuing from the pupa-case and before their
integument is hardened, or they pierce the
soft skin of the cicada, and occasionally
attack the chrysalids of a butterfly. One
of the most curious sources of food are very
young trout. The adult insect attacks these
<i>petits poissons filiformes</i>, ‘literally sucking out
their unsuspective little brains before they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
could escape.’ Grassi is doubtful whether
the adult males feed at all. He states that
he never found any food in their stomach,
nor has he ever seen a male feed. But Professor
Nuttall’s experiments in Cambridge prove
that males were seen repeatedly to feed, and
to feed hungrily, on cherries, dried fruits,
dates, and bananas.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

being sucked by <i>Anopheles maculipennis</i> (female). (From Nuttall
and Shipley.)</div>
</div>

<p>As mentioned before, the proboscis of
the male is too weak to pierce the human
integument, but Howard notes that it will
suck up water, molasses, and beer; and Gray,
at Santa Lucia, mentions that in that island
<i>Culex</i> had developed a marked fondness for
port wine. One particularly favourite food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
is rose-buds covered with aphides—probably
due to the sweetened secretion which these
insects exude. The feeding is sometimes very
ravenous, so that the insects become distended,
the bright colour of blood, or coloured sap,
readily shining through the joints of their
chitinous armour.</p>

<p>The reaction to heat and cold is that
common to many insects. During the winter
the imagines become torpid, quiescent, and
cease to worry one. With returning warmth
they become lively again, and generally wake
from their winter sleep in a state of considerable
hunger. They are insects which prefer
darkness to light, and during the day-time
congregate in caverns and grottos, under the
shade of trees and bushes, beneath bridges,
in barns, and so on. As the sun sinks they
emerge from their hiding-places and fly during
the night.</p>

<p>Cambon, writing on <i>A. maculipennis</i> found
in the Roman Campagna, says that imagines
‘appear a few minutes after sunset and
disappear a few minutes before sunrise.’ We
were able to confirm this at Cambridge. The
insects retired into the shadiest parts of the
boxes in which they were living until the
time of sunset, when a loud buzzing was
heard, and the insects promptly fed on the
food which they had neglected during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
day. We kept our tame mosquitos in a
huge gauze tent, and at night they invariably
accumulated on the side which was illuminated
by a lamp. Such mosquitos as were kept
in a glass lamp-chimney, closed with gauze
at each end, invariably flew towards the end
which was held towards the light. People
who are experienced with mosquitos sometimes
keep the room in which they are sleeping
dark and place a light in an adjoining room,
leaving the door ajar, and thus lure them away.
It seems a curious thing that, while these
insects are repelled by the diffused light of
the sun, they are attracted by the more
concentrated light of a lamp or candle, but
such is the psychology of <i>Anopheles</i>.</p>

<p>It is not perhaps solely the influence of
light; it may be the influence of colour;
for light is very rarely entirely colourless.
In the many experiments carried on in Cambridge
on the natural history of the mosquito,
<i>A. maculipennis</i>, not the least interesting
were those directed to ascertaining the insect’s
preference for colour. It had been noticed
by many observers that they frequented dark-coloured
areas rather than light: for instance,
note how few mosquitos there are on the
white collar of the gentleman in the Frontispiece
compared with the number on his dark
head and coat. Austen had pointed out that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
in a room with a dark dado it was on the
dado that the mosquitos were found rather
than on the whitened walls above. Buchanan
noted that the men when collecting <i>Anopheles</i>
in an Indian hospital found they were to be
most easily got by hanging up a dark
coat or two upon the walls. A white coat
they always avoided. The proverbial yellow
dog of the West is much less bitten than the
Newfoundland, and persons wearing dark socks
and black shoes are more bitten than those
who wear light ones. Natives, although they
suffer less in health having acquired a certain
immunity, are undoubtedly more bitten than
the Europeans.</p>

<p>The experiments we carried on at Cambridge
were as follows: In the large gauze
cubical tent in which the mosquitos were
bred and kept, a number of pasteboard
boxes without lids, measuring 20 by 16 by
10 cm., were piled up. The boxes were lined
with seventeen different coloured cloths, and
were placed in rows one above another, and
the order was changed each day, so that no
question of height from the floor or better
illumination entered into the problem. Counts
were made of the inhabitants of each box on
each of seventeen consecutive days, with the
following results:—</p>

<p>It will be noted that about the level of
the pearl grey there was a marked drop.
Pale green and pale light blue, ochre, white,
orange, and yellow—especially the last two
colours—seem positively to repel the insect.
Our khaki-clothed soldiers have other advantages
than invisibility to the foe. This
matter is worth pursuing farther, and it
might be possible to design mosquito-traps
lined with navy-blue; by periodically exposing <span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
them to chloroform or benzine, or by
sweeping out the contents, considerable numbers
of mosquitos might be destroyed. A dark
blue, sticky solution might be even more
effective. After reading this chapter in the
<i>British Medical Journal</i>, Mr. J. Cropper of
Chepstow wrote to me as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Seeing your article on Colour Selection by <i>Anopheles</i>
reminds me that I found the dark navy-blue
lining of my tent this summer (in Palestine)
extremely attractive to mosquitos, almost entirely
<i>Anopheles</i>; and when the sun got hot I always
noticed an increase in their numbers, presumably
as they came from the herbage and trees near by.
No one ever slept in the tent, and I never found
<i>Anopheles</i> bite in the day-time.</p>
</div>

<p>The best way of ‘downing’ mosquitos
is to prevent the imago hatching, and this,
as has been indicated, can be done by killing
the larvae and the pupae, which is effected
by brushing oil on the water in which they
live. The petrol or crude mineral oil should
be renewed from time to time as it evaporates.
When once the mosquitos are hatched, every
effort should be made to keep them outside
dwelling-houses by means of wire screens,
but if that be impracticable mosquito-nets
should be used at nights. Professor Lefroy recommends
one with sixteen to eighteen meshes
‘to the inch.’ They may be driven away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
a room by burning pyrethum powder in it,
or vaporising cresol or carbolic acid, but of
course this must only be done when a window
is open, through which they can escape.
As regards the human body, mosquitos may
to some extent be kept away by smearing
the skin with the various essential oils—such
as eucalyptus oil or lemon-grass oil, &amp;c.
Mosquitos not infrequently bite through the
socks, but wearing two pairs of socks instead
of one pair, or inserting paper under the socks,
often prevents their reaching the skin, as the
proboscis is not long enough to penetrate two
woollen socks, or strong enough to pierce the
paper.</p>

<p>It is now pretty well accepted that the auditory
organs of the mosquito are situated in the
antennae. Sixty years ago Johnston of Baltimore
was investigating the hearing-apparatus of
a gnat, and came to the conclusion that—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The animal may judge of the <i>intensity</i> or <i>distance</i>
of the source of sound by the <i>quantity</i> of the impression;
of the <i>pitch</i>, or <i>quality</i>, by the consonance
of particular whorls of stiff hairs, according
to their lengths; and of the <i>direction</i> in which the
modulations travel, by the manner in which they
strike upon the <i>antennae</i>, or may be made to meet
either <i>antenna</i>, in consequence of an opposite movement
of that part. That the male should be endowed
with superior acuteness of the sense of hearing
appears from the fact that he must seek the female
for sexual union either in the dim twilight or in the
dark night, when nothing save her sharp humming
noise can serve him as a guide.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

</div>

<p>Johnston also notes that the male mosquito
is the more difficult to catch. The bushy,
complicated antennae of the male show that
of the two sexes, with the mosquito, as with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
man, the male is primarily the hearer, the
one who has to listen.</p>

<p>Another American, Mayer, twenty years
later made some interesting experiments confirming
the views held by Johnston. He managed
to cement with shellac a species of <i>Culex</i>
on to a glass slide, and, placing it beneath a
low-powered microscope, watched the response
of the antennae to tuning-forks of varying
strengths. He found that under the influence
of a fork producing 512 vibrations per second
certain hairs of the antennae vigorously
vibrated, whilst others were left unmoved.
He measured the amplitudes of the vibrations
of these hairs under the influence of the
sound emitted by various tuning-forks. Different
hairs were seen to vibrate to different
notes. Mayer also observed that when the
sound came from a direction in line with the
long axis of the antennary hair vibrations
ceased altogether. Hence he argued that the
antennae could register the direction whence
the sound came. Observing the antennae
under the microscope, he confirmed the view
that the vibrations ceased when the hairs
pointed towards the source of sound, and on
drawing a line in the direction in which the hair
pointed, he found that it always cut within 5°
of the position of the source of sound. He
concludes:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The song of the female vibrates the fibrillae
of one of the antennae more forcibly than those
of the other. The insect spreads the angle between
his antennae, and thus, as I have observed, brings
the fibrillae, situated within the angle formed by
the antennae, in a direction approximately parallel
to the axis of the body. The mosquito now turns
his body in the direction of that antenna whose
fibrils are most affected, and thus gives greater
intensity to the vibrations of the fibrils of the other
antenna. When he has thus brought the vibrations
of the antennae to equality of intensity he has placed
his body in the direction of the radiation of the sound,
and he directs his flight accordingly, and from my
experiments it would appear that he can thus guide
himself to within 5° of the direction of the female.</p>
</div>

<p>There has always been some divergence
of opinion as to how the buzzing sound to
which the male so readily reacts is produced.
Howard once thought that it was due to vibrations
of certain chitinous processes in the large
tracheae. Our experiments showed, however,
that when the wing was cut off closer and
closer to its origin the sound decreased in
volume, but the note progressively rose. Unlike
human beings, the male at all times emits
a higher pitched note than the female, and in
both sexes the note rises after feeding. ‘The
greater the meal, the higher the note.’ This
is, however, by no means confined to mosquitos.
It is a matter which any one must have noticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
when assisting at a public dinner or when dining
in a college hall.</p>

<p>Three unfed females gave a note of from
240 to 270 vibrations. One unfed female
gave an abnormally low note of about 175
vibrations. Four other females, which were
arranged in the order of the distension of the
abdomen, after food gave notes corresponding
to 264-281-297-317 vibrations; whereas
three unfed males all gave exactly the same
note corresponding to 880 vibrations. The
explanation of the higher note of the males is
probably that their wings are markedly narrower
and shorter than those of the females.</p>

<p>Whilst working at <i>Anopheles</i> the late Mr.
Edwin Wilson, the artist who was drawing
our plates, observed at the base of the wing
a structure which may possibly account for
the tone which is so characteristic a feature
of the buzzing. The articulation of the wing
with the body is extremely complex. There
seems to be a series of structures like minute
knuckle-bones articulated with one another,
and at the outer end of the series are two
ribbed rods which may play some part in the
production of the overtones. One is a chitinous
bar with some fourteen or fifteen well-marked
ridges. In certain circumstances we consider
that the other toothed rod can rasp across
the ridges of the bar below it. As the wing is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
raised and lowered it seems probable that the
slightly movable rod would be drawn across
the ridged bar.</p>

<p>We have mentioned above that the mosquito’s
note increased in pitch as the wings
were shortened until a very short stump was
left. As long as these stumps were left a
note was heard, and these stumps would
undoubtedly include the apparatus just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
described, for it is next and nighest the
insertion of the wing into the body. But
Dr. Nuttall found that when this short
stump was removed all perceptible sound
ceased, which is certainly an argument in
favour of these rods and bars playing some
part in the production of the buzzing, and
in opposition to the view of Howard and
others that the buzzing is caused by certain
chitinous structures in the tracheae.</p>

<p>M. J. Perez<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> has carefully gone into the
question of the production of sound in the
Diptera. He claims to have shown experimentally
that the stigmata take no part in
the production of sound. ‘Les causes du
bourdonnement résident certainement dans
les ailes.’ He, too, points out that if the
wings are cut short the notes become more
acute, until the <i>timbre</i> resembles that of certain
interrupters which break and make an electric
conductor. This sound we should attribute to
the stridulator described above. M. Perez definitely
states that both in the Diptera and in
the Hymenoptera the buzzing is due to two
causes: ‘L’une, les vibrations dont l’articulation
de l’aile est le siége et qui constituent
le vrai bourdonnement; l’autre, le frottement
des ailes contre l’air, effet qui modifie
plus ou moins le premier.’ The apparatus we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
have described is, we believe, the mechanism
by means of which the first vibrations are
produced.</p>

<p>In the same periodical M. Jousset de
Bellesme<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> confirms the statement that both
Dipterous and Hymenopterous insects emit
two sounds—one deep and one acute, and
states that the latter is usually the octave
of the former. It is this double note which
gives rise to the peculiar buzzing associated
with these two orders of insects. M. de
Bellesme, like M. Perez, discards the view that
acute sounds are due to any action of the
issuing air in the stigmata, and attributes
it to the vibrations of the pieces of the thorax
which support the wing, and which are moved
by the muscles of flight. It is usually stated
that these muscles are not inserted into the
wing, but into the sides of the thorax, to
which the wing is so attached that when the
lateral walls of this part of the body are
deformed by the action of the muscles the
wings move up and down. But whether this
be the case or not, it is clear that the vibrations
of the sides of the thorax caused by the
muscles of flight—and causing the vibrations
of the wing—will synchronise in number with
these wing vibrations, and will give forth the
same note. The existence of the higher note<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
—‘usually the octave’ of the one produced
by the wing vibrations—is unexplained by
this view. It is, however, easily explicable if
such a stridulating organ as we have described
at the base of the wing in <i>Anopheles maculipennis</i>
be found in other Diptera and in
Hymenopterous insects.</p>

<p>In our paper Mr. Wilson and I thought
it well to figure the upper surface of the
halter as seen under a high magnification.
The drawing showed the hinge on which the
halter quivers—and certain basal papillae, as
Weinland<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> calls them. There is little doubt
that the main function of the halteres is that
of balancing and orientating the insect. They
may, however, have a secondary function;
in some flies they are known to vibrate with
extreme rapidity. It is just possible that
in these rapid vibrations the papillae of the
concave surface rubbing against those of the
convex basal plate may produce a note. As
long ago as 1764 von Gleichen-Russworm<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
observed that when the halteres of the common
house-fly are removed the volume of the
buzzing diminished. This, however, in all
probability is due to the diminished activity
of the wings. On the other hand, Professor
J. Stanley Gardiner informs us that he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
noticed that mosquitos still continue to give
forth a faint note even when their wings are
quite at rest, and this note may possibly be
caused by the halteres.</p>

<p>The part which sound plays in the life of
the mosquito has not been very fully recognised.
Grassi says that people who are talking
are more liable to be bitten by <i>Anopheles</i>
than people who are silent—and quite properly,
we think; people are apt to talk too much,
especially in trains. Joly observes in Madagascar
that mosquitos are attracted by music.
When he played a stringed instrument the
quiescent mosquitos in his room began to
fly about, and if the windows were open
mosquitos were attracted from the outside into
his room, and he notes that mosquitos are
attracted by musicians when at work, or should
we say—at play?</p>

<p>Two curious instances—one recorded by
Howard and the other printed in a letter
to <i>The Times</i>—of the attraction that electric
buzzings have on these insects may be given.
Mr. A. de P. Weaver, an electrical engineer,
of Jackson, Miss., U.S.A., records that, when
engaged in some experiments in harmonic
telegraphy, he observed that when the note
was raised to a certain number of vibrations
per second, all the mosquitos—not only in the
room, but from the outside—would congregate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
near the apparatus, and were, in fact, precipitated
from the air with a quite extraordinary
force, hurling their frail bodies against the
buzzing machinery. This machinery formed,
in conjunction with sticky fly-paper, an excellent
means of capturing them. Mr. Weaver
then devised a means of electrocuting the
pests. He used a section of unpainted wire
screen mounted on a board with pins driven
through the meshes, the heads of the pins
being flush with the surface of the screen.
The bodies of the pins were then electrically
connected together, the whole forming one
electrode of the secondary coil of an induction
coil, whilst the wire screen formed the
other electrode. An alternating current of
high potential was passed, and when the note
was sounded the insects precipitated themselves
to their doom, being electrocuted the
moment they touched the apparatus.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar story is told by Sir
Hiram Maxim in <i>The Times</i> of October 29,
1901. One of the lamps in an installation
which was put up in Saratoga Springs, New
York, hummed in an agreeable manner, and
he noticed that night after night this lamp
was covered with small insects. On closer
examination he found that they were all
mosquitos, and all males.</p>

<p>The eggs of the mosquito are deposited
in fresh water, and at first they are white,
but they very rapidly darken until they
assume a polished black appearance. Each
egg is 0·72 mm. in length, and its greatest
breadth, which is somewhere about its middle,
is 0·16 mm. The egg is boat-shaped, and
one end, as is usual in boats, is slightly deeper
and fuller than the other. The under surface
is fluted, and is marked by a minute network.
The upper surface has a coarser reticulation
which divides the surface into nearly equal
hexagonal areas. The rim of the ‘boat’ is
thickened, and these thickenings are regularly
ribbed; they extend over above the median
third of the egg, and recall the rounded float
which runs along the edge of a life-boat:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
and indeed they serve the same purpose,
for they are composed of air-cells, and their
function is to keep the boat-shaped eggs
right side upward. Soon after the egg has
been laid it is of a greyish-black colour, but
after a certain amount of attrition an outer
membrane splits off—the membrane which has
given the egg its reticulated appearance. This
membrane scales off in fragments, and is of a
grey colour. The egg beneath it is glistening
black—as shiny and as black as patent leather.</p>

<p>One curious fact that Professor Nuttall
and I noticed in the life-history of the egg
is that when it is drawn by capillary forces
a little way out of the water on to the leaf
of a water-plant or some other half-submerged
object, the blunt end always points
downwards. Now the blunt end is the head
end, and thus, should hatching take place
whilst the egg is suspended half in the water
and half in the air, the larva will emerge
into its proper element and not into the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Like other objects floating on the surface,
the mosquito-egg slightly indents the surface.
The number of eggs seems to vary. According
to Grassi, each female deposits about one
hundred eggs, whilst Howard puts the number
as varying from forty to one hundred.
We, however, found in captivity the female<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
laid about one hundred and fifty. According
to Grassi, the eggs of <i>A. maculipennis</i> lie
side by side like the bridges of boats which
span the Rhine, whilst those of <i>A. bifurcatus</i>
arrange themselves with their ends in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
contact, forming starlike patterns. Unlike the
eggs of the gnat (<i>Culex</i>) the eggs of <i>Anopheles</i>
do not adhere together, and the result is they
are very readily scattered by the wind. But
in sheltered places, like a laboratory aquarium,
if undisturbed, the Italian Professor found
that they tended to congregate together, as
indeed do most minute objects floating on
the surface of the water. Our observations
did not entirely confirm those of Grassi. In
Cambridge, at any rate, we found the eggs in
our aquaria always scattered. Very frequently
empty egg-shells were met with, but they too
were scattered. As a rule, in nature, the ova
are deposited in water rich with algae or
other vegetable life, and they are more frequently
in shallow than in deep water, the
temperature of shallow water being naturally
somewhat higher.</p>

<p>On the second or third day after oviposition
(and this depends upon the temperature),
the young larva leaves the egg and
begins to swim in the water. The egg hatches
by the detachment of a cap-like portion of
the anterior end of the egg-shell. There is
no visible ring indicating the limits of this
operculum, but the cap is usually more or
less of the same size. Opinions differ as to
how far desiccation interferes with development
of the larva in the egg-shell. They do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
not seem to be able to stand more than forty-eight
hours of drought. There is no evidence
that they can survive throughout the winter
period. Everything that we know indicates
that the egg must pass this period within the
mother’s body, and that they only attain
maturity in early spring, when the weather
becomes warmer.</p>

<p>The larva of the mosquito is one of
the most fascinating objects one can watch
under the microscope. It is very complex,
and consists of the usual arthropod regions
of (1) the head, (2) the thorax, and (3) the
abdomen.</p>

</div>

<p>Without going into the question of how
many typical somites make up the head,
we must state that the thorax has the typical
number of three, much fused together, and
the abdomen nine. The first seven of these
are very much alike; the eighth, however,
bears the large stigmata or orifices of the
breathing system, and the ninth a number
of beautifully arranged hairs, by means of
which the larva to a great extent steers
itself. The head resembles two-thirds of a
sphere, and is covered with a complete and
clearly defined brown, chitinous case. The
eyes are lateral, and on each side we have
both a simple and a compound eye. In front
of each eye is a little protuberance, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
carries the antenna, and between these two
eminences a band of pigment runs across
the head, from which six symmetrically placed
immovable feathered hairs project, wreathing
the head, as it were, with a halo. There are
many other hairs on the head, whose number
and shape are of great systematic importance.
The anterior edge of the head carries on each
side of its under surface a conspicuous brush,
very like a shaving-brush, the constituent
hairs of which are arranged in a spiral, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
it is these brushes which sweep the food
into the mouth of the young and voracious
larva. The base of this brush is so arranged
that when depressed and bent towards the
mouth the two brushes approximate, but
each brush can move independently and
often does so: one may be depressed towards
the mouth, whilst the other remains erect.</p>

<p>The larva passes its life hanging on to
the under surface of the surface-film of the
water, its dorsal surface being uppermost.
In fact, as Sidney Smith pointed out about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
the sloth, ‘it passes its life in a state of
suspense, like a young curate distantly related
to a bishop.’ But, since these larvae
feed on any kind of organic débris that floats
up to the top and is there arrested by the
surface-film, it is obviously important that
the brushes which sweep together these
organic particles and carry them to the
mouth should be next the surface, and to
effect this the head must rotate through an
angle of 180°; and the head does in fact
turn upside-down on the neck so sharply and
accurately that, as it comes into position, you
almost think, as you are watching it, that you
hear a click, just as you do when you rotate the
diaphragm of a microscope.</p>

<p>The mouth parts now begin to vibrate upwards
and forwards, and the brushes are bent
downwards, backwards, and inwards. Round
the mouth is a small space, the walls of which
are completed by the mandibles, and into
this space the brushes are suddenly bent
back, at the same time the mandibles and
maxillae move forward to meet them. This
movement may take place as many as 180
times a minute, and it produces a current
converging in concentric curves towards the
above-mentioned chamber. The water filters
out between the sides, and any particle of
food is retained by the hairs or by the mouth
appendages; from time to time the mandibles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
are brought together, and their stiff bristles
are run through the brushes as one’s fingers
run through a beard;<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> at other times the
brushes disappear far into the mouth, and
then are slowly withdrawn, passing through
the comb-like bristles on the mandibles. The
brushes are frequently swallowed, and are
withdrawn in little jerks, so that the maxillae
have every opportunity of combing any
nutritive particles out of them. The whole
operation is a most fascinating one to watch.</p>

<p>As far as one can judge, the currents set
in motion by the action of all these forces
extend in an area equal to twice the length
of the larva, or even more. The currents
are in the plane just below the surface-film,
and any organic matter lighter than water
is swept towards the mouth. In fact the
larva sweeps the lower side of the surface-film
of the pond or puddle just as a careful housemaid
might sweep spiders and flies off a ceiling
with a hand-brush.</p>

<p>The principal food-supply of the larva
consists of the spores of fresh-water algae,
diatoms, particles of <i>Spirogyra</i>, and any other
organisms which do not penetrate the surface-film.
Occasionally the larvae devour the decaying
leaves of duck-weed (<i>Lemna</i>), and sometimes
they attack their dead fellows.</p>

<p>Grassi found the intestine of the larva<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
to contain protozoa, unicellular algae, and
other organic detritus. In course of time
some object too big for the larva to swallow
is brought to its mouth by the currents, but
after a very short struggle this is rejected.
The minuter particles accumulate in the
chamber for a certain time, and then are
swallowed by a gulp-like motion and thus
pass into the oesophagus.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part V</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Amongst aquatic larvae, the most beautiful and delicate
are those of numerous species of gnat.—(<span class="smcap">Goring and Pritchard’s</span>
<i>Micrographia</i>, 1837.)</p>
</div>


<p>In the young larva of <i>Anopheles</i> the head
is broader and deeper than the thorax, but
in the older larvae the segments that succeed
the head have at least twice its diameter.
It is a characteristic of true flies, or Diptera,
that the thorax should not exhibit that
separation into three divisions which is so
usual in the less specialised insects—such as
the cockroach and this is peculiarly true
of the larva of the mosquito—at any rate,
so far as its external structure goes. The
abdomen of the larva consists of nine free
segments; the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and
seventh of these bear palmate hairs on the
dorsal or upper surface, something like
hands with fourteen ‘fingers’ spread out.
These hairs adhere to the under layer of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
surface-film of the water, and help to maintain
the animal in a horizontal position just below
that film. When the larva relaxes its hold and
sinks into the water, it not infrequently
carries with it air-bubbles enclosed by these
fourteen ‘fingers.’</p>

<p>The eighth abdominal segment bears the
stigmata or the openings of the respiratory
apparatus, and the ninth segment has abandoned
the flattened and square cross-section
of its predecessors, and is cylindrical and
tapering. The posterior end of the body is
cut off sharply. Round the posterior opening
of the alimentary canal are four white, soft
papillae, which are well supplied with tracheae
and are capable of contracting and expanding.
Above these are four very prominent hairs,
two median and two lateral, and ventrally
to the ninth abdominal segment is a fan-shaped
arrangement of hairs springing from
two pieces of very complicated structures.
These hairs seem to act to some extent as
a rudder, and they probably serve as an
accessory organ of locomotion. Possibly they
have also a sensory or tactile function, and
act, as so many posterior filaments do in
insects, as antennae ‘from behind.’</p>

<p>We have referred above to the respiratory
openings, and, indeed, these are the key to
the whole situation. Close these openings—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
as they can be closed by floating petrol or
other oil on the surface of the water—and
‘the trick is done.’ The larvae and the
pupae can no longer breathe, and there is thus
no imago to “carry on.” In <i>Culex</i> (the gnat),
these respiratory orifices are borne on a long
tube directing dorsalwards—a tube which is
larger and longer than a segment of the body,
and whose presence gives the larva the appearance
of a <b>Y</b> with slightly unequal limbs.
These breathing-openings are of the greatest
complexity, but the outstanding fact is that
these stigmata pierce through the watery
film and put the respiratory system of the
larva into communication with the atmosphere
of the whole cosmos. If anything frightens
the larva, certain side-pieces and flaps fold
suddenly backwards and over the stigmata,
the connexion through the surface-film is
broken, and the little larva, like a German
submarine when it sights an English battleship,
darts below, frequently carrying with
it the drop of air attached to the rim of the
respiratory recess which surrounds the openings
of the two stigmata.</p>

<p>Not infrequently the larva ceases to lie
parallel to the surface of the water, its
palmate hairs are put out of action, and then
its body hangs down into the water, but it
still maintains its respiratory connexion with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
the outer air through these breathing-pores.
From time to time the hairs mentioned above
are brushed over by the mouth parts and
cleaned of any débris.</p>

<p>The larvae, when they leave the surface-film
sink by their own weight; but they not
infrequently swim actively downwards, their
swimming action being very like that of an
eel. When returning to the surface they are
entirely dependent upon their powers of
swimming, being slightly heavier than water.
When the tail reaches the surface-film the
larvae are at once arrested, and immediately
cease their swimming-movements. They invariably
move tail forwards, and the hairs
which we have mentioned above at the posterior
end of the body undoubtedly act as ‘buffers’
or ‘fenders.’ As a rule, when they are above,
they are actively engaged in feeding; but at
the bottom they lay inert, as though feigning
to be dead. Kept in a glass beaker they are
apt to lie with their respiratory apparatus
attached to the concave film, which capillary
attraction draws up on the surface of the
glass. Their heads then point towards the
surface of the beaker. If forcibly kept below—say,
by submerging them under a watch-glass—they
are frequently enabled to breathe by
attaching the openings of their respiratory
apparatus to an air-bubble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>The general colour of the larva is a mottled
brown, darkening where the chitin thickens.
The older larvae are to some extent green,
possibly due to their food; but this green
colour is not by any means confined to the
alimentary tract. After moulting, the issuing
larva is a uniform light lavender colour,
which, however, very soon darkens.</p>

<p>A strong wind passing over a pool where
<i>Anopheles</i> eggs, larvae, or pupae are floating,
will gradually pile them all up on the side
towards which it is blowing. The <i>Anopheles</i>
larvae undoubtedly are braver than those
of the <i>Culex</i>—that is to say, a disturbance
which will send all the <i>Culex</i> larvae scurrying
to the bottom will leave the <i>Anopheles</i> larvae
unmoved.</p>

<p>When first hatched the larvae measure
somewhere about 0·7 mm. to 0·95 mm., but
when ready to pupate they have attained
the length of 7 mm. The rate of development
is greatly influenced by the temperature, and
a few cold days will markedly retard the
larval growth. In warm sunny weather, larvae
will pupate between the second and third
week, but larvae taken in August (if the
autumn be cold) do not attain their full
growth until November. The young larvae
undoubtedly die in considerable numbers, and
the act of pupating is also attended with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
certain and varying dangers. Out of 834
larvae and pupae caught in Cambridgeshire,
636 were small larvae, measuring less than
4 mm.; 181 were large larvae, measuring
up to 7 mm. But only 17 pupae were taken.
There are other facts
which show that the
larvae under natural
conditions succumb
in very considerable
numbers.</p>

of late pupal stage of <i>Anopheles maculipennis</i>. <i>f</i>, The

Shipley.)</div>
</div>

<p>When the larva
is about to turn into
a pupa it comes to
rest, and now the
thoracic regions are
more swollen than
ever. Soon a dorsal
slit appears along
the larval cuticle
and the pupa slowly, but gradually, emerges
through this slit and leaves the larval chitinous
cuticle behind it. On first emerging, the
pupa measures about 6·5 mm., the head and
thorax making up one-third of this. During
the last larval stage many of the pupal organs
have been re-forming and are more or less
visible through the cuticle. The mouth parts
and limbs of the third stage—the future
imago—show no relation to those of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
larva. They are there enclosed in their respective
sheaths, but these are quite independent
of the larval ‘appendages.’ The respiratory
trumpets, which, as in the larva, pierce the
surface-film, are ready to act as breathing-organs.
Whereas the larvae breathe through
two stigmata at the posterior end of the
abdomen, the pupae breathe through two
respiratory trumpets issuing from the anterior
dorsal surface, and it is these trumpets, together
with certain palmate hairs, which
support the pupae in the right position and
put the respiratory organs at this stage
into communication with the outer atmosphere.
During the pupa stage <i>Anopheles</i>, like the
pupa of other insects, takes no food.</p>

<p>The pupa is something like a tadpole,
with its tail bent under its body and flapping
up and down, instead of from side to side.
The whole pupa is enclosed in a thin semitransparent
membrane, through which the
organs of the adult can readily be seen. As
it grows older its colour darkens. Until about
the time when it will give rise to the fly, the
pupa floats quietly at the surface, breathing
through its respiratory trumpets. When disturbed
it shows considerable activity, and
it is by no means always easy to capture
by means of a pipette. At the least sign
of danger it darts below with a series of inter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>mittent
strokes and rests at the bottom of
the water. Its own buoyancy brings it back
to the surface, as, unlike the larva, it is lighter
than water. Not only has it a certain amount
of air in its tracheae, but there is a reservoir
of air at the posterior end of the thorax
which acts as a very efficient float. When
retreating below the surface the respiratory
trumpets usually carry down with them two
minute air-bubbles.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">C</span> and <span class="allsmcap">D</span>,

</div>

<p>The sex of the pupa can be determined
by the lobes at the posterior end of the tail:
<span class="allsmcap">A</span> and <span class="allsmcap">B</span> (Fig. 24) representing the male, and
<span class="allsmcap">C</span> and <span class="allsmcap">D</span> the corresponding parts of the female.
The duration of the pupal life is generally
three to four days, but conditions of temperature
and the state of the natural surroundings
exert considerable influence upon the rate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
of development. Howard has pointed out
that the addition of creosote or creosote-oil
to the water in which the larvae are living
hastens the metamorphosis into pupae, and
the pupa stage is passed through in as short
a time as fifteen hours instead of the normal
forty-eight hours of the warm waters of
the Southern States in America. It has also
been observed that showery weather hastens
the rate of development.</p>

<p>When the adult mosquito is about to
emerge, a certain amount of air is secreted
under the chitinous casing of the pupa. A fine
streak containing air appears along the back,
extending between the respiratory trumpets
and the base of the head. This central streak
gradually passes backwards until it reaches
the seventh abdominal segment, and then
suddenly the pupa extends its abdomen so
that it floats parallel to the surface of the
water instead of being under the rest of the
pupa’s body. The chitinous integument now
splits along the median dorsal line, and through
the slit thus made the thorax of the adult
mosquito now protrudes. By gradually pressing
its abdomen against the pupa-case, the body
of the perfect insect is slowly but gradually
raised above the surface of the water. The
head is pulled backwards and upwards, and
millimetre by millimetre the mouth parts, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
palps, and antennae are withdrawn, and at first
remain bent backwards beneath the body of
the insect. Gradually the bases of the wings
and the abdomen emerge, and soon the wings
are freed and immediately flatten out and
begin to harden. The legs and the tip of
the abdomen alone
now remain to be
dealt with. At
this stage the insect
projects far
beyond the anterior
end of the
pupa encasement,
and somewhat
resembles an exaggerated
figurehead
on a ship.
The pupa-case is
still filled with air,
and acts as a float to support the emerging
insect. At last the front legs are being
freed, the second and third pair of legs soon
follow, and now the insect is standing on
the surface of the water raised on its tarsal
joints, the tip of the abdomen being the last
part to free itself from the pupa-case.</p>

  <div class="captionl"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span>—Imago of a
mosquito extracting itself from the pupa-case, which floats on the
surface of the water. Magnified. (From Guiart.)</div>
</div>

<p>The exit of the fly is naturally a very
critical period in its life-history, and in many
cases it is fatal. The freeing process takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
between five and ten minutes. When undisturbed
the emergent fly rests for a time
until its wings and limbs are sufficiently
hardened to enable it to fly, or at least to
walk about. Sometimes the mosquito takes
its first flight straight from the pupa-case;
at other times it rests awhile before taking
to the air. The young imago is pale in colour,
the thorax being brown and the abdomen
transparent, with a greenish tinge. At first
the abdomen is much longer than it is later, for,
almost immediately after the mosquito’s exit
from the pupa-case its abdomen begins to
contract, and from its hinder end four or five
drops of a glistening, greenish-white fluid are
exuded.</p>

<p>The newly born imagines generally take to
flight between five and ten minutes after
they have emerged, and they at once begin
to darken in colour, and in two hours assume
the normal dusky colour of the adult. If
anything hinders the insect from properly
extending its limbs immediately on issuing
from the pupa-case, the parts harden and
remain distorted throughout life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Anyone who has spent a day or two in
Lille or Bruges, or other towns in Picardy
and in Southern Belgium, will understand
why, as my Uncle Toby has it, ‘Our army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
swore terribly in Flanders.’ The incessant
and tireless biting of mosquitos would make
any army swear, even though they were
ignorant—as my Uncle Toby’s army certainly
was ignorant—that the gnats, as they called
them, conveyed tertian and quartan ague.
In Europe the trouble is a summer or early
autumn trouble; but our troops are fighting
in many tropical and sub-tropical countries,
where the mosquitos—like the poor—are
always with them.</p>

<p>That the plague can now be checked is
shown by the making of the Panama Canal;
and that this check is due to British science
is shown by the work on the life-history of
the malarial organism, first investigated by Sir
Ronald Ross, and later, as regards the human
parasites, by certain Italian savants. It is also
due to the public health services of one or two
British medical officers of health in the East.
<i>Their</i> methods have been applied and improved
by those responsible for the elusive channel
which now at times separates North from
South America.</p>

<p>We have seen that the larva and the pupa
hang on to the surface-film of the water by
means of certain suspensory hairs, and by
the openings of their breathing-apparatus.
Anything which prevents the breathing-tubes
reaching the air ensures the death of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
larva and pupa, and then there is no issuing
adult—hence the use of paraffin on the
pools or breeding-places. It, or any other
oily fluid, spreads as a thin layer over the
surface of the pools and puddles and clogs
the respiratory-pores and the larvae or pupae
die of suffocation.</p>

<p>In Ismailia the disease has been reduced
to an amazing extent, and remarkable results
have followed the use of these preventive
measures at Port Swettenham in the Federated
Malay States. Within two months of the
opening of the port in 1902, 41 out of 49
of the Government quarters were infected,
and 118 out of 196 Government servants
were ill. Now, after filling up all pools and
cleaning the jungle, no single officer has
suffered from malaria since July 1904, and
the number of cases amongst the children
fell from 34·8 to 0·77 per cent. The only
melancholy feature about this wonderful alleviation
of suffering, due to the untiring efforts
of the district surgeon, Dr. Malcolm Watson,
is that his fees for attending malarial cases
dropped to zero.</p>

<p>Thus, even ten years ago, a considerable
degree of success had attended the efforts
of the sanitary authorities—largely at the
instigation of Sir Ronald Ross—all over the
world, to diminish the mosquito-plague. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
is, of course, equally important to try to
destroy the parasite in man by means of
quinine. This is, however, a matter of great
difficulty. In Africa and in the East nearly
all native children are infected with malaria,
though they suffer little, and gradually acquire
a high degree of immunity. Still, they are
always a source of infection; and soldiers
stationed in malarious districts should always
place their dwellings to the windward of
the native settlements.</p>

<p>Knowing the cause, we can now guard
against malaria; mosquito-nets and wire-protected
windows and doors are a sufficient
check on the access of <i>Anopheles</i> to man.
If the mosquito and man could only be kept
permanently apart, we might hope for the
disappearance of the parasite from our fauna.
In relieving man from this world-wide pest,
all genuine lovers of animals will rejoice that
we are also relieving the far more serious
lesions of one of the most delicate and
beautiful insects that we know.</p>

<p>It has always been a source of surprise
to me that the great resources and the very
evident enthusiasm of the anti-vivisection
societies have not been turned in this direction.
In the malarial parasite, we have a most potent
vivisector of the entrails of one of the most
charming and graceful of creatures, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
poetry of movement is hardly approached and
never equalled by the ladies of the front row of
the ballet. A little help, a very little help,
would free these fascinating flies from a form
of trouble far worse than that the human
alternative host suffers. Yet, as far as I
know, these societies and the societies for the
prevention of cruelty to animals have declined
to help in any way, and have knowingly
allowed thousands of millions of animals to
perish annually by a most painful death, and
have never stretched out a helping hand to the
fairy-like and fascinating mosquito.</p>

<p>Like other branches of human activity disease
has its romantic and its unromantic side. Nobody
can regard mumps or measles as romantic.
On the other hand, yellow fever calls up all
the romance of slave-trading, pirates and the
Spanish Main, buccaneers, maroonings and
other grisly horrors, whose sole redeeming
feature was a touch of romance. Lovers of
pirate stories—and who are not?—will always
remember their graphic description of Yellow
Jack in the West Indies.</p>

<p>We have probably always had disease with
us since the creation of the world—that act
of ‘<i>impardonnable imprudence</i>,’ as Anatole
France calls it; but the first description of
yellow fever only dates back to 1647, when
an outbreak occurred in the Barbados. Then,
as now, it devastated the shipping of the port,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
and was soon introduced by ships into St.
Christopher and, later, into Guadeloupe. The
following year it was in Cuba, and in 1655 in
Jamaica, and it gradually spread throughout
the whole of the West Indies until a century
or more later it reached the Island of St.
Thomas.</p>

<p>One of the peculiarities of the disease is
that it frequently disappears from a given
locality for long periods of time. For instance,
it was absent in Barbados after the first
outbreak until 1690, and when it recurred it
was at first not recognised as being the same
disease which devastated the islands forty-three
years before. In the eighteenth century
there was another break of fifty-four years,
and similar breaks can be recorded in most
of the West Indian islands.</p>

<p>Besides the West Indies, it is at present
endemic in Brazil and on the west coast of
Africa, and is common in Mexico. Whether
the disease arose primarily in Africa and is
part of the toll the American continent has
had to pay for the slave-trade, or whether it
was brought to the west coast of Africa from
the other side of the Atlantic, is not certain.
It apparently appeared as a regular disease
in Brazil in the year 1849, and from that time
onwards, with the exception of one year, has
been a permanent trouble at Rio. From time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
to time the disease has been carried to neighbouring
parts of America, especially to the
Gulf, Central America, and the northern coast
of South America. It has been introduced
more than once into Monte Video and Buenos
Ayres, and has even penetrated up the Parana
as far as Asunçion. Every few years it extends
into the Southern States and has even
reached Philadelphia and Boston. With the
exception of an outbreak in Leghorn in 1804,
European epidemics have been confined to
Portugal, Spain, and the Balearic Islands.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed that most of these
outbreaks occur on the coast and then pass
up the rivers. It is thus most probable
that the disease is one which is brought mainly
by ships. It is obviously a disease which
must be guarded against by our troops fighting
near the coast in West Africa, as well as such
troops as are left in the West Indies. But, above
all, it must be guarded against in relation to
our shipping fleet and our Navy, operating off
the South American coasts. The danger,
now the Panama Canal is open, of introducing
the disease from America to Asia is a danger
that should carefully be considered.</p>

<p>Yellow fever is a disease which requires a
winter temperature of at least 68° F., for it is a
mosquito-borne disease, and the yellow-fever
mosquito flourishes best at about this tempera<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>ture.
It can be introduced into a new locality
by the arrival of an infected mosquito, or by
the arrival of an infected human being. In
the former case the disease breaks out within
a few days; in the latter at least ten or twelve
days elapse before new cases arise, for, as we
shall see later, the organism, whatever it is,
that causes the fever is not capable of passing
from the mosquito until it has been in its body
for ten or twelve days.</p>

<p>Thirty-six years ago Finlay of Havana
suggested that the virus of yellow fever was
inoculated by mosquitos; but it was not until
the publication of the discoveries by Sir
Ronald Ross and others, that malaria is transferred
by A<i>nopheles</i>, that a thorough investigation
of yellow fever was made. In the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
year of the last century an American Commission,
consisting of Drs. Walter Reed, Carroll, Agramonte,
and Lazear, investigated the whole
subject, and, taking extraordinary risks, were
able to prove that the infection was not
conveyed by contact or through the air, or
from bedding or clothes soiled by the dejecta
of yellow-fever patients, but by a mosquito
of the genus <i>Stegomyia</i>. Whatever the virus
is, it is invisible, even under the highest powers
of the microscope. It can be filtered through
a Berkefeld filter. It is destroyed by heating
to 55° C. If the blood of a yellow fever
patient, during the first three days, be inoculated
into a healthy man he gets yellow fever,
and it is only during the first three days that
the blood is infective. On the other hand, the
mosquito is incapable of transferring the
disease until the unknown organism has been
in its own body for at least ten or twelve days.</p>

</div>

<p>The mosquito in question belongs to the
species <i>Stegomyia calopus</i> (Blanchard), or, as
it is more often called in English textbooks,
<i>Stegomyia fasciata</i> (Fabricius). The genus
<i>Stegomyia</i> differs from other <i>Culicidae</i> in having
a dark grey or black colour, whilst the <i>Culicidae</i>
are as a rule browner. <i>Stegomyia</i> also has
silver-white spots and silver glistening scales,
especially on the back of the legs and on the
abdomen. The grown-up mosquito is com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>paratively
small, and very elegant. Its length
is some 3 to 4 mm., but if the mouth parts be
added is some 6 to 6½ mm. long. As is usual,
the male is smaller and feebler than the female.
When settled—as, for instance, whilst sucking
the blood of its host—it rests upon its first four
legs only, the two hindmost being stretched out
abaft like pennants waving
in the air; but in general
it has the hump-backed
appearance of <i>Culex</i> and not
the straight outline of
<i>Anopheles</i>. The colour is
greyish black, modified by
numerous white spots and
rings. There is a white rim
round the eyes, and a very
characteristic lyre-like
pattern on the dorsal surface of the thorax.
The structure of the mouth parts is much
the same as that of any other <i>Culicidae</i>.
The antennae have fourteen joints, the last
two of which in the male are longer than
the others. As is again usual, the antennae
of the male have long brush-like hairs,
organs by means of which they find the female.
The legs are banded alternately with white and
black rings. It is this character, indeed, which
has given this mosquito the name of the
‘tiger-gnat.’ The wings are very iridescent.</p>

  <div class="captionl"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>—Larva of
<i>Stegomyia fasciata</i> breathing on the surface of the water. Highly
magnified.</div>
</div>

<p>The pupa of <i>Stegomyia</i> is darker and
blacker than that of <i>Culex</i>, and, seen from the
side, the head and the thorax are somewhat
more triangular than the same parts in <i>Culex</i>.
As the pupa grows older it grows darker.
The length of the larva is 4 to 6 mm., somewhat
larger than that of the
gnat. But, like that, it
has a respiratory-tube
stretching out from the
last segment of the abdomen,
almost at right angles
to the rest of the body.
This respiratory-tube is
much shorter than that
of <i>Culex</i>, but is long enough
to enable the larva to
hang obliquely down into
the water. The eggs are
very large. They are covered by a mass
of small ‘cells’ containing air, and they never
tend to form a conglomerate mass like those
of <i>Culex</i>, but are laid singly, and remain
isolated until the larvae hatch. After floating
a certain time they usually sink to the bottom
of the water. Their length may be about a
millimetre, and their colour is almost black.
When the egg hatches, the anterior third of
the shell splits off and the larva at once
emerges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>As is so often the case with mosquitos, it
is the female alone which bites. The male
nourishes itself on plant-juices, saps, and so on—especially
they like sugary secretions—and
in the absence of blood the female is reduced
to a similar diet. Hence <i>Stegomyia</i> is
comparatively common in dwellings where
sweetstuffs are—bakeries, sugar-refineries,
and so on. These mosquitos
are, like the cockroach,
the fly, and the bed-bug, inhabitants
of human dwellings. They
are indeed domesticated, and are
always to be found in the neighbourhood
of human houses or
buildings or ships, and are very
rarely indeed found far away from
the sphere of man’s activities.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp30" id="fig29" style="max-width: 12.5em;">

  <div class="captionl"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>—Egg of <i>Stegomyia fasciata</i>
(highly magnified). Notice the air-‘cells.’.</div>
</div>

<p>They are very apt to bite one in the neck,
creeping along the darker parts of the
clothing until an unprotected region of the
body is reached. Unless one has very thick
socks they frequently bite the ankle, and they
are as tireless in their pesterings as ever Mrs.
Pardiggle was—no sooner are they driven
away than they return to the attack. The
bite is painful, and in many people raises a
considerable swelling.</p>

<p>The <i>Stegomyia</i> bite not only during the night,
but also during the day. According to R. O.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
and O. Neumann—in Brazil, at any rate—they
are capable of biting not only during the twilight,
but at any times. The bite lasts twenty to thirty
seconds, after which the mosquito rests a bit,
waving its third pair of legs in the sun. After
this rest she flies away to some sheltered spot,
and whilst blood is being digested the mosquito
takes nothing but water—a very proper
dietetic measure. After three or four days
the female is ready for another meal.</p>

<p>In the absence of man these mosquitos
will suck blood from other animals, and in
confinement they are generally fed on rats
or canaries, and they will even suck up a
drop of blood presented on a piece of cotton-wool.</p>

<p>If the female mosquito has been fertilised
before the sucking of blood she will commence
egg-laying two or three days later, and two or
three days later again the larva will emerge.
The larval stage lasts from nine to twelve
days, and the pupa stage three to four, so that
the whole metamorphosis takes from sixteen
to twenty-two days. Hence, during warm
weather, many generations succeed each other,
but one must have a temperature of at least
20° to 27° C. Below that temperature the
processes tend to slow down, and under a
temperature near freezing-point the regular
development is definitely interrupted. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
the interruption is only a suspense, and living
activities are resumed should the temperature
rise again.</p>

<p>It is a disputed point whether these mosquitos
must have a meal of blood before they
can lay eggs, and on this point the evidence is
not yet sufficient to make a dogmatic statement.
These mosquitos are very indifferent
where their eggs are laid. The smallest collection
of water in an empty sardine-tin, a broken
tumbler, a puddle in the street, a gutter-pipe,
is good enough for <i>Stegomyia calopus</i>. She will
even lay her eggs on moist cotton-wool.</p>

<p>Although <i>Stegomyia</i> bites freely during
the day-time, it, as a rule, avoids the light
and seeks some dark shelter. Contrary to the
habits of <i>Anopheles</i>, it prefers a light ground
to rest upon. The larvae live on algae,
vegetable-matter, or plant-detritus, or, in
captivity, on white bread or Indian corn.
They can remain for a considerable time
without food, and this without materially
diminishing the rate of their development.
<i>Stegomyia</i> breeds well in ships, and is occasionally
found in one part only of the ship—such
as the engine-room or cook’s galley, where
the conditions seem to be most favourable
to its development. Thus it comes about that
at times certain quarters of a ship provide the
greatest percentage of yellow-fever cases.</p>

<small>THE BISCUIT-‘WEEVIL’<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
 (<i>Anobium paniceum</i>)</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Let us be merry,’ said Mr. Pecksniff. Here he took a captain’s
biscuit. ‘It is a poor heart that never rejoices; your hearts
are not poor. No!’—(<span class="smcap">Dickens</span>, <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.)</p>
</div>


<p>The first things to notice about the biscuit-‘weevil,’
so familiar to readers of Marryat’s
novels, is that it is not a weevil at all, and that
it attacks a great many other comestibles
besides biscuits. The so-called biscuit-‘weevil’
is in truth an <i>Anobium</i>—<i>Anobium
paniceum</i>—a member of the family <i><span class="smcap">Ptinidae</span></i>
and is closely allied to <i>A. striatum</i>, which makes
the little round holes in worm-eaten furniture,
so cleverly imitated by the second-hand
furniture-dealers. Another species of <i>Anobium</i>
(recently re-christened <i>Xestobium tessellatum</i>),
a somewhat larger insect, is destructive in
churches, libraries, and old houses. Their
mysterious tappings (which are really efforts
to attract the other sex—mere flirtations)
are the cause of much superstitious dread in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the nervous, and this species is known as the
‘greater death-watch.’</p>

Sharp, <i>The Cambridge Natural History</i>, vol. vi.)</div>
</div>

<p>But to return to the biscuit-‘weevil.’
The mature insect is about a quarter of an inch
long, and lives at large; it is the larva which
burrows into and attacks the
dried biscuit—the ‘hard-tack’
of the Navy. Less of a woodborer
than its allies, it nevertheless
attacks almost any vegetable
substance; and Butler tells us
that ‘rhubarb-root, ginger,
wafers, and even so unlikely a
substance as Cayenne pepper
have been greedily devoured
by it.’ Several generations
have been known to flourish
on a diet of opium, and it has
been found in tablets of compressed
meat. Vegetable matter, even in an
altered state—such as paper—affords it an
ample meal; and in one case the larva of
an <i>Anobium paniceum</i> bored steadily in a
straight line through twenty-seven folio
volumes in a public library, and so straight
was the tunnel that a string could be
passed through it from end to end. In one
of our libraries at Cambridge some Arabic
manuscripts were almost entirely destroyed
by the larvae, which do not hesitate to browse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
on drawings and paintings and the dried
paper of herbaria.</p>

</div>

<p>The larva of this beetle is in truth a book-worm.
Its interest for us in the present series
is, however, the disastrous infestation of ships’
biscuits, which frequently is so severe that
the sailors ‘hard-tack’ is rendered uneatable.
Heating, of course, kills it; but the biscuits are
still uneatable. The dead larvae are as unpalatable
as the living. The contrivance of
biscuit-tins since Marryat’s time has done
much to lessen the evils. Tradition has it
that a great firm and a great fortune had
their foundations laid, during the first half of
the last century, by the accidental contiguity
of a baker’s shop and that of a tinsmith.</p>

<small>THE FIG-MOTH<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>

<p>The extension of the War to Turkey and
Asia Minor has drawn attention to the existence
of certain insects whose larvae exercise
a very deleterious effect on valuable food-supplies
in the Near East. The inhabitants
of Asiatic Turkey, without knowing it, have
from time immemorial adopted the advice
of Captain Cuttle: ‘Train up a fig-tree in
the way it should go, and when you are old
sit under the shade on it. Overhaul the——
Well,’ said the Captain, ‘on second thoughts,
I ain’t quite certain where that’s to be found,
but when found, make a note of.’</p>

<p>Asia Minor may indeed be described as
the fig-ground of the East, and anything that
interferes with the fig as a food is likely to
interfere with the well-being of our troops</p>

<p>in Egypt and the Near East. In ‘The Minor
Horrors of War,’ I described a species of moth,
<i>Ephestia kühniella</i>, a member of the family
Pyralidae, which infests and destroys Army
biscuits; but this other species, <i>E. cautella</i>,
which attacks figs, is even more troublesome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
than the one described in the above-mentioned
book.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Whoever has attentively eaten dried figs
must from time to time have become aware
that there is something very defective in
their flavour, and on close inspection little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
clusters of débris will be observed on the
outside of the dried fruit—the dejecta of
the larva burrowing within—and numerous
round holes can be detected through which
the larvae have made their entrance. If
cut open and carefully examined, one or
two small white grubs may be found, which
give the fig a singularly sour-bitter and most
unpleasant taste. This is the larva of the
moth, <i>Ephestia cautella</i> which has for the
last four or five years been attracting much
attention in the Levant market. From 15
to 50 per cent. of the figs exported from
Smyrna, the great centre of the fig-trade, are
infected with this ‘worm,’ and active steps
were being taken before the War spread to
the Near East to check its ravages. The
moth itself is very like <i>E. kühniella</i>, but
readily distinguished by an entomologist.
Originally, it seems to have come from Asiatic
Turkey, but by the aid of commerce it has
been distributed in a broad belt all round
the world within certain limits of temperature.
Wide as its distribution now is, it is equally
catholic in its tastes. Perhaps it does as
much harm to the chocolate trade as to any
other, attacking the cacao-bean as well as
the prepared article; all sorts of nuts
are infested. At one time it was thought
that the oil of the nuts was the attraction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
but the larvae flourish just as well on rice
and bran, on dried apples, dried insects, maize,
and a great variety of other more or less
nutritive substances.</p>

<p>But to return to the figs. So serious
was the trouble felt to be in the American
fig-market that, in 1910, the authorities at
Washington sent Mr. E. G. Smyth of the
Bureau of Entomology to investigate the
insect in Asia Minor, where the figs come
from, and from his report the following
account is taken:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The manner of the fig-harvest is as follows:
During August the figs are ripening on the trees,
and are gradually dropping off to be collected from
the ground and laid on strips of reeds, called ‘serghi,’
a yard broad; and here for two to five days they
dry in the sun. When dried, they are packed in
goats’-hair bags or woven willow baskets, and carried
by horse or by camel to the fig-depots in the neighbouring
villages. Here they are collected from the
whole district, mixed together, and re-sacked for
transmission by railroad to the coast. At Smyrna
they are graded and prepared for the market: the
better kind being either ‘layered’ or ‘pulled,’ whilst
the inferior fruits are strung on strings or exported
in the form of a mashed cake to make the ‘strawberry’
jam of the Western breakfast-table.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig34" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <img  src="images/fig34.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="captionl"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span>—‘Serghi’ of
reeds laid in long rows, used in large orchards. Over these the moths
congregate by thousands at night.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Smyth’s object was first to find out
at what stage the figs become infected by the
moth, and then if possible to suggest pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>ventive
or remedial measures. He minutely
investigated every stage in the preservation
of figs, from the ripe fruit on the tree to the
preserved figs in the hold on the steamer
bound for New York, and the conclusion
he came to is this: With very rare exceptions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
the eggs are never laid on the fruit whilst
on the tree. The first and by far the most
important infection is when the figs are gathered
and exposed on the reed ‘serghi.’ Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
about seven in the evening the moths begin
to appear, and steadily increase in number
as the evening wears on. The actual deposition
of the ova cannot be observed, for
the moths get down amongst the reeds and
lay their eggs on the under surface of the
fruit—usually in some crack or abrasion—so
that the newly hatched larva can more
easily make an entrance into the fig. From
some ‘counts’ made at Tchifte Kaive it
appears that after an exposure of one night
29 per cent. of figs were infested, after two
nights 38·5 per cent., and after three nights
44·5 per cent.</p>


<div class="figcenter illowp36" id="fig35" style="max-width: 37.5em;">

<div class="captionl"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span>—Figs packed
by string method (reduced).</p></div>
</div>

<p>A second and serious source of infection
is at the village depots. Before the figs
arrive, there seem to be no specimens of the
<i>Ephestia</i> in the buildings; but with their
arrival the moth appears, and so favourable
is the shelter from the heat and the wind,
and so abundant is the supply of figs as sack
after sack is emptied on to the floor, that soon
the moth is more abundant in the depots
than amongst the ‘serghi,’ and the wonder
is that a single fig escapes infestation.
Fortunately, the time spent in the depots
is short, often only a night; were it much
longer, the whole crop would suffer. On their
way down to the coast again there is little
or no risk of the moth, but arriving at Smyrna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
we pick up the insect again in the ‘khans,’
where the figs are prepared for export, but
in the larval form. Here, in August and
September, little trace of the insect is seen,
the larvae are then too small to emerge and
pupate; but by October many full-grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
larvae may be found on the fig-heaps or
crawling up the walls; a few pupate inside
the figs, and these probably produce the
few imagines found in the ‘khans,’ at the
port of shipping. The unpleasantness of the
larvae crawling all about the ship greatly
detracts from the pleasure of a voyage on a
vessel laden with Smyrna figs.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp90" id="fig36" style="max-width: 75em;">

  <div class="captionl"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>—Pile of
refuse-figs in a Smyrna ‘khan:’ On the wall, above these figs, fig-moth
larvae congregate in large numbers.</div>
</div>

<p>With regard to preventive measures, there
seems in many parts of Asia Minor to be
two crops of figs—one in May and June and
one later. The former produces a large,
watery fig, unfit for sale. It is left to rot
on the ground, but it serves as food for the
larvae which will produce the myriad swarms
of moths in the early autumn. Obviously
these worthless figs should be destroyed as
completely as possible. Equally obvious are
the suggestions that the figs should be covered
at night with some cheap covering whilst
on the ‘serghi,’ and screened from the moth
whilst in the depots, and their sojourn there
should be as short as possible. Measures
for destroying the larvae in the fig usually
take the form of heat—either hot air, hot
water, or steam. Each is effective, and each
has certain advantages and disadvantages;
still, the more progressive merchants of Smyrna
were, before the War, experimenting trying to
find the best means of destroying the larvae, and
in time a uniform system will probably emerge.</p>

<p>The common names for common insects in
English are confusing. Not only are the
same insects frequently known by different
names on different sides of the Atlantic, but in
many cases quite different insects—insects even
belonging to different genera—are connoted
by the same common name. In this respect
matters are different in Germany: partly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
perhaps, because the Germans on the whole
are more scientifically inclined than we are,
but partly, I suspect, because the German
language lends itself more easily to express
in one word—however long—the characteristics
of any given insect.</p>

</div>

<p>The genus <i>Stomoxys</i> is generally called
in Great Britain the ‘stable-fly,’ but there
are other ‘stable-flies.’ One of the commonest
species of the genus is <i>S. calcitrans</i>, a two-winged
muscid fly, not at all unlike the common
domestic fly, <i>Musca domestica</i>; but there are
one or two points which readily distinguish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
it from the commoner insect. To begin with:
it has a hard, firm, chitinous, piercing proboscis,
which when at rest stretches forward
in front of the head, and when in action is
pressed down at right angles to the longitudinal
axis of the body; then, again, when
resting, its wings diverge; those of the house-fly
approximate. Like other flies, the <i>Stomoxys</i>
varies somewhat in length, between 5·5-7 mm.
The thorax has on its back four longitudinal,
dark stripes, broken by a transverse suture;
and, as the accompanying figure shows, the
third of the great, long veins which traverse
the wing is much more slightly bent than
is the case in <i>Musca domestica</i>. Further,
whereas the hinder edge of the eye in the
house-fly is straight that of the stable-fly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
is concave, and the antennae bear hairs on
the upper side only and not above and below
as they do in the domestic fly.</p>

  <div class="captionl"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span>—Wing of
<i>Musca domestica</i> above, and of <i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i>
below.</div>
</div>


<p>As a biting-fly and a blood-sucking fly,
the habits of <i>Stomoxys</i> naturally differ from
those of <i>Musca domestica</i>; but, like the latter,
its distribution is almost world-wide. It is
found in all temperate and tropical countries,
and extends as far north as Lapland. But it
is perhaps most abundant (or shall we say
it has been most observed?) in temperate
climates and during the summer months.</p>

</div>

<p>In any farm or country house large numbers
of <i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i> are found in and about
the cowsheds and stables, and in warm weather
the same is true wherever cattle are grazing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
in the field. Later in the year, at the
beginning of autumn, they are frequently
found indoors, and in some ‘fly counts’ they
have furnished quite 50 per cent. of the
flies of a country house, the remaining 50 per
cent. being made up of many other species and
genera. When resting
on a vertical surface
<i>Stomoxys</i> generally has its
head pointing upwards,
whereas, as a rule, the
house-fly rests upside
down. The adult fly
feeds upon any decaying
matter; but whenever it
can, it sucks the blood of
vertebrates, and at times
is a real nuisance to
animals as well as human
beings. So voracious are
they that should a well-fed
one be injured, the others immediately
attack it and suck up every drop of blood
which it had secured for its own food.</p>

<p>It has often been disputed whether a
meal of blood is essential to the female mosquito
before oviposition, but it seems perfectly clear
that the female <i>Stomoxys</i> can produce fertilised
eggs without having had a meal of
blood.</p>

  <div class="captionl"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span>—<i>Stomoxys
calcitrans.</i> Eggs. (After Newstead.)</div>
</div>

<p>The female lays a number of white, banana-shaped
eggs a few inches below the surface
of any decaying organic matter; fermenting
grass from the lawn, decaying garden stuff,
stable manure—each forms a favourable nidus.
The eggs are laid in a heap like those of the
house-fly, each heap containing from fifty
to seventy. The egg is 1 mm. in length
and has a grooved side, through the thicker
end of which the larva escapes when the
egg-shell splits.</p>

  <div class="captionl"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span>—Acephalous
larva of <i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i>. (After Newstead.)</div>
</div>

<p>The issuing larva is almost transparent.
It not only has no head, but the anterior
end dwindles almost to a point. When fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
grown it attains a length of 11 mm., and the
larval stage usually lasts from two to three
weeks; but development may be retarded
by adverse circumstances up
to eleven or twelve weeks,
and in such cases the full-grown
larvae are often
stunted in size. In these circumstances
the pupae they
produce are markedly smaller
than those which have followed
a more normal course
of development. As is true
of the egg and of the larva,
the pupa resembles the pupa
of the house-fly, being barrel-shaped
and of a chestnut-brown
colour; it is 5 to 5·5
mm. in length. The pupa
stage lasts from nine to thirteen
days, but this period is
prolonged by cold.</p>

<p>On emerging from the
pupa-case the insect has to push its way to the
surface of the rotting vegetation in which it has
been produced. This it does partly by the
alternate inflation and deflation of the so-called
‘frontal sac,’ and by actively pushing forward
the body by means of its legs. Once on the
surface the insect begins to clean itself, pumps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
air into its body, forces it along the tracheae in
the wings, which expand and ultimately harden.
In the processes of unfolding they are aided
by the hind legs. For a time the insect is
immobile, gradually stiffening; but when the
integument has hardened it flies off to explore
the outer world. Under normal conditions
the whole life-cycle varies from
twenty-seven to thirty-seven
days.</p>

  <div class="captionl"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.</span>—Coarctate pupa

</div>

<p>The chief interest of <i>Stomoxys</i>
to the public, rests upon the fact
that it is a very potent carrier
of disease. There are certain
forms of <i>Trypanosoma</i> which,
under experimental conditions,
are undoubtedly transferred by
this species. But opinion is still
unsettled as to whether the transference
of these protozoa occurs in nature. The
<i>Surra</i> diseases of horses and camels is, according
to some authorities, transferred by <i>Stomoxys</i>,
and so is the <i>Surra</i> disease of cattle; and
there are others, all fully set forth in Mr.
Hindle’s work on ‘Flies and Disease.’</p>

<p>Certain thread-worms—for instance, <i>Filaria
labiato-papillosa</i>—which occur in the peritoneal
cavity, and sometimes in the eyes
of cattle and deer in India, are undoubtedly
conveyed by <i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i>. The super<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>ficial
vessels of the cattle swarm with the
larvae of these thread-worms, which readily
pass through the proboscis of the insect into
its stomach. They then wriggle through the
walls of the stomach and make their way
into the thoracic muscles; here they undergo
a ‘rest-cure,’ and after a time they are readily
transferred to a new and possibly uninfected
host.</p>

<p>But by far the worst infection which
is attributed to this fly is acute epidemic
poliomyelitis, or infantile paralysis. That this
disease occurs in epidemics has been known—especially
in Scandinavia—for some time; and
eight years ago it attracted serious attention
in North America and in our country. In
1907 there were many local outbreaks in
the United States and Canada, and it is
thought that the infection was first introduced
from Scandinavia along the Atlantic
coast, and later, inland, as far as the State
of Minnesota, by the numerous Scandinavian
immigrants that settle there.</p>

<p>The disease is one of those which are
apparently due to a protozoon too small
to be visible under the highest power of the
microscope, and so small as to be able to
pass through a Berkefeld filter. It can readily
be artificially transmitted to monkeys. It
is thought that the disease is by no means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
transmitted only by means of the biting
<i>Stomoxys</i>, and that it may be directly transmitted
from one person to another without
the aid of any intermediate host. But there
seems little doubt that it can be, and is,
transmitted by <i>Stomoxys</i>, and therefore it is
of the highest importance to reduce the
number of these insects.</p>

<p>The most efficient way of controlling this
pest is to destroy or put out of action
its breeding-places. All decaying vegetable
matter should be either removed or burnt
or buried, or covered with some agent which
will prevent the larvae living. In fact, the
methods that have been advocated for the
common house-fly are applicable to <i>Stomoxys</i>.
If stable manure were carefully removed,
from May to October, at least every seven
days, the number of flies would be materially
reduced. Where this is impracticable, manure-heaps
should be covered with some insecticide,
so as to destroy the eggs and larvae.
Experiments are still being made with the
view of finding a substance capable of killing
the eggs, larvae, and pupae, which will be
at once cheap and unharmful to the fertilising
value of the manure. The American experts
recommend borax or colemanite (crude calcium
borate), calcined, powdered, and applied by
a flour-dredger. The proportions which seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
most effective are 0·62 lb. of borax and 0·75 lb.
of colemanite to 10 cubic feet, or 8 bushels
of manure. Two or three gallons of water
should then be sprinkled over the manure-heap.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">
Now, Muse, let’s sing of rats!</p>
<p class="psig">(<span class="smcap">Grainger.</span>)</p>


<p>The overwhelming majority of rats fall under
two species: (i) <i>Mus rattus</i>, the black rat, and
(ii) <i>Mus decumanus</i>, the brown rat. The
original home of both species is, according
to Dr. Blandford, Mongolia; but the date of
their first appearance in our islands is a matter
of some uncertainty. According to Helm, <i>M.
rattus</i> passed into Europe at the time of the
<i>Völkerwanderung</i>, and doubtless accompanied
the migrating Asiatic hordes on their journeys
westward. The name rat appears in early High-Dutch
glossaries, it is mentioned by Albertus
Magnus, and occurs in early Anglo-Saxon
writings in England. This evidence is, however,
not conclusive that in those times the rat had entered
Great Britain; indeed, according to Bell,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
the black rat was not known here until before
the middle of the sixteenth century: at
least, he says, no author more ancient than
that period has described, or even alluded
to, it as being in Great Britain, Gesner being
the first to do so. Jenyns, in his ‘Manual
of British Vertebrate Animals,’<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> describes <i>M.
rattus</i> as ‘truly indigenous’; but this is in
comparison with the brown rat, whose comparatively
recently arrival he chronicles. <i>M.
rattus</i> is said to have been common on the
continent of Europe in the thirteenth century.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig44" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <img  src="images/fig44.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span>—<i>Mus
rattus.</i> (From Pennant.)</div>
</div>

<p><i>M. rattus</i> has, as a rule, greyish-black
fur above, ash-coloured below, with a tail a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
little longer than the body and head. It is
smaller and more elegantly built than the
brown rat; its snout is longer and more slender,
and the long, thin, scaly tail is about eight or
nine inches in length. The British forms
average in length seven inches from the tip of
the nose to the origin of the tail. Although
known as the black rat, its bluish, or greyish-black
colour is, both in the East and in Northern
America, frequently replaced by brown on the
upper surface, and by white fur on the lower,
or by a yellowish-brown rufous colour. The
ears, feet, and tail are black. When kept as
pets—and they frequently are—white and
piebald varieties are often bred. The ears are
larger in proportion than in <i>M. decumanus</i>,
the rings of scales on the tail better marked,
and spines in the fur are not uncommon.</p>

<p>The black rat, or Old-English rat, begins
to breed under the age of one year, and goes
with young six weeks; it breeds frequently
during the year, but does not commence in
Bombay, according to the Plague Commission,
until it has attained the weight of at least
70 grammes. In India they breed all the year
round. In Britain they produce six to eleven
young at a time; in India the average is 5·2;
the largest number found by the Plague Commission
having been nine. In Bombay it is
noteworthy that in both species the percentage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
of young rats to the total rat population is
greater during the warmer months—from June
to October—than at other times of the year.
It is also noteworthy that the fall in fertility
begins before the onset of the plague epizootic,
though, later, it roughly coincides with it.
In Britain they increase so fast as to overstock
their abode, and thus they are forced, from
deficiency of food, to devour one another, and
this alone, Pennant thinks, ‘prevents even
the human race from becoming a prey to them,
not but there are instances of their gnawing
the extremities of infants in their sleep.’</p>

</div>

<p>The black rat is catholic as to its diet,
omnivorous, and it devours every kind of
human food. It is more domesticated than
its congener, more devoted to human habitations,
and it does immense damage to stored
grain, seeds, and cereals. It is a better
climber than <i>M. decumanus</i>, which accounts
for its being <i>par excellence</i> the ship-rat, since
it can climb hawsers and more readily ‘comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
on board.’ It makes its way up to the higher
rooms of the tenement houses in Indian cities,
where it nests and breeds undisturbed by the
human inhabitants.</p>

</div>

<p>Pennant<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> draws attention to the harm the
black rat causes by gnawing and devouring
not only edibles, but paper, cloth, water-pipes,
and even furniture. In England it makes a
lodge—either for the day’s residence or a nest
for its young—near a chimney, and ‘improves
the warmth by forming in it a magazine of
wool, bits of cloth, hay, or straw.’ In the
East it nests in the indescribable rubbish and
‘unconsidered trifles’ the natives accumulate
in their rooms, and is seldom, if ever, interfered
with.</p>

<p>Its climbing-habits enable it to ascend trees,
and in India it frequently nests among the
branches. In some tropical islands <i>M. rattus</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
lives exclusively in the crowns of coco-nut
palms, feeding almost entirely on their fruit.</p>

<p>Contrary to the opinion of Blandford,
Oldfield Thomas thinks that the black rat
originally came from India, and thence spread
all over the world, exterminating the indigenous
rats of other countries, only to be exterminated
later by the arrival of the stronger <i>M. decumanus</i>.
At the present time the last-named
species is not yet established in some countries—for
instance, in those of western South
America. On that continent, <i>M. alexandrinus</i>,
a tropical variety of <i>M. rattus</i>, is waging war
on the less highly organised native rice-rats
(<i>Sigmodon</i>). <i>M. alexandrinus</i> has a grey or
rufous back, and a white belly.</p>

<p><i>M. rattus</i> has a milder, more amenable,
and tameable character than <i>M. decumanus</i>,
and the white, or pied varieties, so dear to
schoolboys, are of this species. It is cleanly
in its habits, and the skin is kept in excellent
order. Like other rats, it holds its food in its
hands whilst eating, and it drinks by lapping.</p>

<p>Although the black rat is tending to be
driven out by the brown rat, it still lingers
on in some warehouses in London, at Yarmouth,
in Sutherlandshire, I believe in Lundy Island,
and I have been told it occurred not so very
long ago on the island in the Serpentine. It
doubtless occurs in many other places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p><i>Mus decumanus</i>, the so-called brown rat,
undoubtedly comes from Central Asia; and
at the present time there is a rat in China
described under the name <i>M. humiliatus</i>,
which is so little distinguishable from the brown
rat that it is thought to be the parent form.</p>

<p>The migration westward of the brown
rat certainly took place much later than that
of <i>M. rattus</i>. Its first appearance is
difficult to date. Undoubtedly large hordes
of them crossed the Volga in the year 1727,
and continued their journey towards Central
Europe. The following year, according to
Pennant, brown rats, appeared in England—Jenyns
says not till 1730—and almost certainly
they came in ships, for on its journey overland
it only reached Paris about the year 1750.
Reaching England about the year of the
second George’s accession, and but thirteen
years after the first of the House of Hanover
succeeded to the throne, it was called—probably
by the adherents of the Stuart cause—the
Hanoverian rat. It was also called the
Norwegian rat—possibly from the mistaken
idea that it reached these islands from that
country. It has now passed to the northern
half of the New World, where it is gradually
driving out many of its weaker brethren. Its
numbers are, however, kept within certain
limits by wolves, lynxes, raccoons, coyotes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
opossums, and other carnivora, and especially
by the skunks, which enter barns and out-houses
in search of it.</p>

<p>Until the discovery of America, the rat
and mouse were unknown in the New World,
and the first rats who ever saw it are said to
have been introduced in a ship from Antwerp.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The brown rat is of a greyish-brown colour,
tinged with yellow and white beneath. The
tail is not so long as the body. It is a larger
rat than <i>M. rattus</i>, has shorter ears, a more
powerful skull, and ten to twelve mammae. Its
ears, feet, and tail are flesh-coloured. Like <i>M.
rattus</i>, colour varieties occur often: the melanistic
variety, not uncommon in Ireland, being
sometimes mistaken for the black rat. It
is a larger animal than its congener, more
heavily built, with a more powerful head, and
blunter jaws. The head and body measure
some eight to nine inches, but the tail, as a
rule, does not surpass the length of the body
alone. Its weight averages about nine ounces.
It is extremely fierce and extremely cunning,
and in the struggle for existence with allied
species has hitherto been consistently successful
in the fight.</p>

<p><i>Mus decumanus</i> is very prolific, and produces
several litters a year, each averaging eight
to ten in number, but twelve or even fourteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
young are not very uncommonly born at one
time. It begins breeding young—a half-grown
female producing a litter of three or four;
but in Bombay the sexes do not breed until
they have attained at least a weight of
100 grammes. The young are naked, i.e.
without hairs, and of a beautiful pink colour.
They are blind, and their ears are gummed
down over the auditory meatus. They are
very weak and helpless, and need that maternal
care, which, to do the female rat justice, is
never withheld.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span>—<i>Mus

</div>

<p><i>M. decumanus</i> is less attached to the dwellings
of man than <i>M. rattus</i>; still, it does live
in houses, though, owing to a lack of climbing
power, it is never found above the third floor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
It is largely a burrowing animal, and makes
its nests in its burrows. <i>M. rattus</i> can also
burrow, but not so readily, and it nests not
in the burrow, but in some obscure corner.
A curious instance of the nesting habits of
this species was found during the rebuilding
of my ‘lodgings’ in 1911. In searching under
the boards of the floor of the rooms of our
Foundress the Lady Margaret, Mother of Henry
VII, now the drawing-room, the workmen found
the mummified remains of four rats, which
had taken to themselves coverings or shrouds;
and upon investigation these proved to consist
of a vellum deed relating to the College, some
paper documents relating to Thomas Thompson,
who was Master of the College from 1510 to
1517, and some fragments of printed matter
which turned out to be part of an early Virgil;
four leaves of a Horace; two leaves of a
primer of Wynkyn de Worde; and finally a
leaf of a work by Caxton. In addition, four
playing-cards of the sixteenth century were
found.</p>

<p>The brown rat frequents barns, granaries,
stables, slaughter-houses, rivers, ponds, ditches,
drains, gullies, and sewers—it is, in fact,
sometimes called the sewer-rat. It is less
particular in its food than the black rat,
which is more usually found in grain-stores.
Although in Bombay the relative numbers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
of <i>M. rattus</i> and <i>M. decumanus</i> caught was as
seven is to three, in open spaces, gardens,
&amp;c., the latter was much the commoner.
Yet the report of the Plague Commission
states that the authors ‘do not think it an
exaggeration to state that every inhabited
building in Bombay City and Island, not
excepting even the better-class bungalows,
shelters its colony of <i>M. rattus</i>.’</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="fig47" style="max-width: 46.875em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span>—Head of <i>Mus
decumanus</i>. (From Flower and Lyddeker.)</div>
</div>

<p>Both species readily take to water, though
<i>M. rattus</i>, being the better climber, more
readily gets on shipboard. They will swim
rivers and arms of the sea. The rats which
infest the London Zoological Gardens are
said to swim nightly the canal in Regent’s
Park. Rats constantly make their way to
coastal islands, and in a comparative short
time clear the place of indigenous rabbits
and birds. Puffin Island, off the coast of
Anglesea, and the Copeland Islands, in Belfast
Bay, are two examples of islands at one time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
leased for the sake of their rabbits to people
who had to give up the lease after the rats
had landed on them. Similar cases are known
off Denmark. They greedily eat birds’ eggs,
and are said to convey them over considerable
distances, though how they do this is
not very clear. After the destruction of the
vertebrate land-fauna, they fall back upon
the dwellers in the littoral, and live on prawns,
shrimps, and molluscs. They are very fond
of fish, and Lyddeker, in the ‘Royal Natural
History,’ states that they occasionally catch
and eat young eels. As their parasites show,
they eat insects such as the meal-beetle,
and when in the field they eat land-snails,
insect larvae, and other food, which conveys
into their bodies the same tape-worms, &amp;c.,
which we find in the hedgehog and in the
smaller carnivora.</p>

<p>They are, in fact, omnivorous, and nothing
in the way of human food is alien to them.
They do enormous harm to corn-ricks and
to stored grain. They are inveterate enemies
of the hen-roost, the pigeon-house, and, as
we have seen, of the rabbit-warren. When
pressed by hunger, they readily turn cannibal,
and the brown rat easily masters the black.
There are stories of some few specimens of
each species being left in a cage overnight;
on the following morning there were only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
brown rats in that cage. To some extent they
help to keep down one of the field-mice (Genus
<i>Microtus</i>), and this is especially the case in
North America;<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> but the benefit is doubtful
since they are held to be at least as destructive
to the crops as the field-mice, and probably
more so.</p>

<p>The ferocity with which they defend themselves
when attacked is well known, and
at times, when they are driven by hunger,
they do not hesitate to attack man. They are
said to nibble the extremities of infants, and
in one—apparently authentic—instance they
overcame and devoured a man who had entered
a disused coal-mine tenanted by starving
rats. The bite is said to be severe (they will
bite through a man’s thumb-nail into the
flesh), and the bite is long in healing.</p>

<p>Rats eat much garbage and offal, and readily
feed upon dead bodies. About sixty years
ago there stood, at Monfaucon, a slaughter-house
for horses, and this it was proposed
to remove still farther from Paris. It is
stated that the carcasses of the horses
slaughtered—which sometimes amounted to
thirty-five a day—were cleared to the bone
by rats in the course of the following night.
This excited the attention of a M. Dusaussois,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
who made the following experiment: He
placed the carcasses of two or three horses
in an enclosure, which permitted the entrance
of rats by certain known and closable paths.
Towards midnight, he and some workmen
entered the enclosure, closed the rat-holes,
and in the course of that night killed 2650
rats. He repeated the experiment, and by
the end of four days had killed 9101 rats,
and by the end of a month 16,050 rats. During
the process of these experiments other carcasses
were exposed in the neighbourhood,
so that in all probability M. Dusaussois
attracted to his enclosure but a small proportion
of the total available number of
rats. All around this slaughter-house the
country was riddled with extensive burrows,
so that the earth was constantly falling in. In
one place the rodents had formed a pathway,
500 yards long, leading to a distant burrow.</p>

<p>A rat census can never be taken; but,
estimating that there is one rat for every human
being on these islands, or less than one rat
for every acre of ground, a moderate estimate
would give us 40,000,000 rats at any one time.
It has been calculated that a rat does at least
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> worth of damage during the course of
the year: hence in Great Britain and Ireland,
we may annually charge them with a loss of at
least £15,000,000!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>From what has been said it is obvious
that rats cause enormous damage to humanity,
which is counterbalanced by the almost
infinitesimal good they do as scavengers. I do
not propose to consider in detail the harm
they do as disease-carriers, but one cannot
forget that the rat is the primary host of
<i>Trichinella spiralis</i>, which, when conveyed
from the rat to the pig, and—by eating uncooked
or imperfectly cooked pork—from the
pig to man, causes severe and very fatal
epidemics, and enforces the expenditure of
large annual sums on meat inspection. They
further convey a virulent form of equine
influenza from one stable to another, and also
the ‘foot-and-mouth’ disease. But what is
infinitely more important to man than all the
other injuries put together is the harm they
bring to suffering humanity by conveying
the bubonic plague from one patient to
another. The plague under which India and
great parts of Burma are ‘groaning and
travailing,’ is caused by a specific bacillus
discovered in 1894 by Yersin at Hong-Kong.
It flourishes in other vertebrates besides man
and the rat, but, owing to the migratory
habits of the latter, the rat is the most effective
agent in the spread of the disease. Both
species of rat seem about equally susceptible,
and the presence of the microbe showed no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
special relation to either the age or the sex of
either species. The microbe is conveyed from
rat to rat and from rat to man by a flea.</p>

<p>The destruction of the rat is now being
urged on all hands, and in the near future
we shall probably see a considerable diminution
in their numbers in the more civilised countries
of the world. This will mean a considerable
upset in the balance of power of the almost
hidden fauna which surrounds us on all hands.
It may even, as the Medical Officer of Health
for Bristol has pointed out, lead to an increase
of immigration of ship-rats—those most likely
to be infected by plague—to take up the
places vacated on land by the slain. By one
of those commercial agencies—I do not propose
to go into the merits of any one of them—which
the enterprise of our merchants is
now pressing on the public, a large landed
proprietor a few months ago completely freed
his buildings of rats and mice. A few weeks
later his house and out-buildings were overrun
by swarms of what to him—for in the
time of the rats and mice he had never seen one—was
a new and formidable insect. He sought
the aid of the Royal Agricultural Society, who
referred the matter to their scientific adviser,
who pronounced the insects to be cockroaches!</p>

<p>Mr. H. Warner Allen, the representative
of the British Press with the French Army,
writes as follows in the <i>Morning Post</i>:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Of the smaller trench annoyances few are more
worrying than the plague of rats. Shelters and
trenches, no matter where they are made, whether
in woods or open fields or on the mountainside,
become immediately infested with the objectionable
creatures. In one case within my own personal
knowledge they drove a French officer out of a
comfortable and commodious dug-out into a damp
and melancholy shelter, which was to some extent
protected from them by sheets of corrugated iron.
The plague had attained considerable dimensions
before a really organised attempt was made to deal
with it, and there were many cases of rats actually
biting men who were chasing them down the trenches.</p>

<p>Terriers have proved of considerable assistance.
Trains full of dogs have been dispatched to the
Front, and poison has been fairly effective. Lately,
a reward has been offered for every dead rat brought
in by men in the trenches, and regular battues have
been organised. In a single fortnight one army corps
alone has disposed of no fewer than 8000 rats. At
a halfpenny a rat this has involved an expense of
£16, and it was certainly money well spent. The
sport of rat-catching on such very advantageous terms
has proved very popular among the men, who now
suggest that the standing reward offered for the more
dangerous and more exciting form of sport involved
in the capture of a German machine-gun should be
raised to a higher figure.</p>
</div>

<p>Ferrets have been largely used in the
British trenches, but their price is now very
high, and the supply is very limited. The
method which has had some success in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
combatting the rabbit-plague of Australia—killing
all captured females and let all captured
males loose—is certainly worth a trial. Rats
will gnaw through concrete, but not if plenty
of pieces of broken glass be mixed with the
concrete. They will never cross a band of tar
which has been kept liquid by mixing with
grease. In the French trenches, special rat-runs
are dug and these are provided with
‘live’ wires. On touching one of these the
rat is electrocuted.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century, among the
officers of his ‘Britannic Majesty,’ was an
official rat-catcher, whose special uniform was
scarlet, embroidered in yellow worsted with
figures of field-mice destroying wheat-sheaves.
Inquiry at the Lord Chamberlain’s office
has satisfied me that the officer still exists
and still catches rats, but I fear the uniform
has been abolished. However, a book has
recently appeared dealing officially and exhaustively
with all matters of this kind, and
as soon as I can come by it, I will look the
matter up. Should this dignified uniform
have really disappeared, might not a humble
petition be presented that it be revived?
Surely, never more than at the present time
should the honour and glory of the rat-catcher
be exalted!</p>

<p>Another member of the <i><span class="smcap">Muridae</span></i>, the field-mouse
(<i>Apodemus sylvaticus</i>), is almost as
great a nuisance in the trenches as the rat.
The field-mouse is very like the house-mouse,
with some of its features seen under a lens.
The hind feet and ears and eyes are larger
than are those of the house-mouse. Perhaps
its much longer hind legs help most easily to
differentiate the two species. The tail is of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
about the same length as the body and head
added together, and is annulated, presenting
some 150 rings. The hands have five-palmar
pads, and the feet six pads. There
are six mammae in the female, the anterior
pair being pectoral.</p>

<p>The general colour of the dorsal surface
is described as wood-brown, which pales at the
front end and towards the shoulders and flanks,
and grows to a more reddish tinge at the posterior
end. The whole of the lower surface
is of dull, white, silvery colour, and on some
well-developed specimens there is a spot of
buff, or orange, on the throat, which sometimes
lengthens out to form a collar. Moulting
seems to be rare—at any rate but a few cases
have been recorded.</p>

<p>The field-mouse occurs all over Europe,
and extends into parts of Asia. It is found
all the way from Iceland, southward to Algiers,
and from Ireland to India. In the Himalayas
it has been taken at a height of 11,500 feet,
and in the mountains of Europe it frequently
occurs at a height of 7000 feet. It is certainly
the most universally distributed of European
animals, and the number of individual specimens
probably far exceeds that of any other
mammal which occurs in its district.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="fig48" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <img  src="images/fig48.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="captionl"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48.</span>—The
field-mouse (<i>Apodemus sylvaticus</i>). (From Barrett Hamilton.)</div>
</div>

<p>The field-mouse does not hibernate like
the dor-mouse, but is active and hardy at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
all seasons of the year. Although, like other
<i><span class="smcap">Muridae</span></i>, it is probably vegetarian by ancestry,
it is, in effect, quite omnivorous. It
causes considerable loss in cornfields and
gardens, especially to early-sown peas; it
eagerly eats dandelions and any kind of grain or
nut, or berry, or fruit, or bulb, or bud. Even
fungi have been found in their winter stores;
and one family was discovered which had eaten
considerable quantities of putty with appar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>ently
no deleterious effect. Their fondness for
bulbs is a great nuisance to the Dutch tulip-merchants.
As many as 300 have been trapped
in a fortnight in a single crocus-bed. They
are also a nuisance to bee-keepers, inasmuch
as they enter the hive and eat the honeycomb,
especially during the winter. Whilst feeding
in the hedgerows, or undergrowth, they frequently
establish themselves in birds’ nests, and
occasionally such nests become their permanent
home.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In the hedge-sparrow’s nest he sits,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When the summer brood is fled,</div>

    <div class="verse indent10">(<i>Sketches of Natural History</i>, 1834.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They are not above sucking the birds’ eggs,
or even devouring the young birds. They
will sometimes enter disused tunnels and
devour hibernating flies and other insects.
Unlike rats, they seldom enter human habitations,
and they are quite innocent of the
peculiar odour which is so disagreeable in
the house-mouse; and unlike the house-mouse
and the harvest-mouse they are seldom found
in stacks of corn. Their preference for berries
explains the fact that they generally haunt
woods and hedgerows, and their passion for
growing corn accounts for the fact that they
swarm in cornfields towards harvest-time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>The field-mouse, however, does not neglect
open and barren districts, and is found from
the sea-beach to the mountain-tops. It seems
to flourish equally well in the flower-beds of
the London parks and on the lonely hills of
Scotland. Its activities are largely confined
to the night-time, which may account for the
exceptional size of its eyes. It is described
‘as bounding along in a peculiar zig-zag and
erratic manner, remotely resembling the movements
of a kangaroo or jerboa.’ Its spoor is
very characteristic. The hind feet pressing
nearly on the same spot as the fore feet, but
less lightly than the latter. From time to
time it sits upright, pricking its ears; and
obviously its sense of hearing is very acute,
for it distinguishes sounds inaudible to the
human ear. It is mild in manner, gentle and
inoffensive, extremely timid, and most easily
trapped. It is to some extent gregarious,
as many as fourteen or fifteen sometimes
being found in the same burrow.</p>

<p>As Fig. 49 shows, the burrow generally
has an entrance which is marked by a little
heap of excavated earth. This leads down
into the nest where food is often stored.</p>

<p>The field-mouse is prolific, the female producing
several litters throughout the greater
part of the year. The mother carries the young-born
litter about for two or three weeks, nipping
the skin of her offspring at the side, half-way
between the fore and hind legs. The
average number of young born at one time
is probably somewhere about five, though
litters of nine are by no means unknown. All
predaceous animals naturally eat field-mice,
and they are the favourite food—at any rate,
in some localities—of owls.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> It might be well to repeat the fact that the genus <i>Ephestia</i>
belongs to the family <i>PYRALIDAE</i>, which is by most authorities
included in the <i>Microlepidoptera</i>. The Speaker’s sneer at the entomologists
who work at this group (see his letter in <i>The Times</i> of
February 2, 1916) is hardly worthy of one of the chief trustees of
the British Museum. As a chief trustee, he must have been aware
of the exhibit of the Microlepidoptera, <i>E. kühniella</i>, and its devastating
action on the biscuits supplied to our soldiers by the War Office,
which has for many months occupied a prominent position in the
middle of the central hall of the Natural History Museum at South
Kensington. This exhibit showed how closely the study of the
Microlepidoptera is associated with the food-supply of our soldiers
in many parts of the world.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
